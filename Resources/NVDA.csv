2022-01-03T13:49:38Z,"5 ETFs To With Major Growth Potential In January And Beyond, From Sports Betting To The Metaverse","The year 2021 left behind some huge storylines for investors. The investment themes may carry over into 2022, which could make some thematic ETFs worth considering in January and further into the year.
Here is a look at five ETFs for investors to consider in 2022.
Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE: BETZ)

Launched: June 2020
Assets Under management: $287 million
Price: $24.82
52-Week Range: $22.55 to $33.26
Year-to-date: -4%

The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF offers pure-play exposure to a high growth, well publicized storyline for investors and sports fans. More states are legalizing sports betting and more sports and teams are partnering with betting companies. After a strong 2020, this ETF ended 2021 down on the year.
The company counts many international names in the top 10 holdings including Kindred Group, Kambi Group, Flutter Entertainment (OTC: PDYPY) and Entain. Rush Street Interactive (NYSE: RSI), Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ: PENN) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) also rank in the top 10 holdings.
While there is some risk of sports pausing their seasons or delaying their games, sometimes a schedule change can work out as a positive with more dates for bettors to wager on.
The ETF and its holdings should get plenty of headlines in early January, with the NCAA Football Championship Game coming on Jan. 10, 2022. The ETF could also benefit from the NFL’s Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Last year’s Super Bowl set a sports betting handle record and saw heavy customer acquisition promotions by company’s to boost user totals.

2022-01-05T14:55:27Z,What Does the Selling of Bonds Tell Us About Investor Sentiment?,"While equity index futures are still pointing to a lower open on Wednesday, they did trim some losses after the ADP Nonfarm Employment report showed strong gains in December. More than twice as many workers as expected found jobs last month, particularly in leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation, and utilities. Much of these gains may have occurred before the Omicron variant really hit the scene so we’ll have to wait and see if they stick.
Later today, the FOMC Meeting Minutes will be released and investors will have insight into what the Fed has been discussing, particularly related to tapering and future interest rate hikes.
The Nasdaq-100 Futures (/NQ) are leading the slide on Wednesday once again. The Cboe Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN)—also known as the Vixen—is the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) equivalent of the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index), which is related to the S&P 500 (SPX). The Vixen rose 5.43% on Tuesday as investors sold tech stocks. While this may signal trouble for some tech companies, the fact that the VIX was relatively unchanged could be a good sign for the majority of stocks in the near term.  
One company that struggled to grow on Tuesday was Scott’s Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG). Scott’s fell 2.79% after providing guidance saying it would maintain its full-year earnings outlook, but its Hawthorne cannabis division expects a 40% decline in sales. The company cited the slowdown in the cannabis market and issues with the supply chain.
The ISM Manufacturing PMI was lower than expected, suggesting that manufacturers are seeing fewer orders. December was the 19th straight month of increases, but the slowdown may actually be a welcomed reprieve because it may provide relief to an already strained supply chain.
The JOLTS report also showed a decrease in job openings in November. The Great Resignation continues as the “quits” rate remained high. In the light of Wednesday’s ADP report, it may be that workers were simply quitting one job to take another job. Friday’s Employment Situation report could provide greater insights to these job market developments.
Many stocks turned bearish after the manufacturing and job opening announcements; the S&P 500 (SPX) was positioned for a new all-time high, but it turned negative ..."

2022-01-05T22:42:29Z,"What Investors Should Know About Amazon, Sony And John Deere's Latest To Push Into The Electric Vehicle Sector","Many traditional automotive companies have been transitioning into the electric vehicle space, which for years has been dominated by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the United States.
While names like Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE: GM) are known to be heavily investing in EVs, three names announcing plans this week to begin the development of electric vehicles might be surprising to readers.
Sony: At the past two Consumers Electronics Shows, Sony Corp (NYSE: SONY) has hinted at getting into the electric vehicle space, even showing off a prototype last year.
During CES 2022 on Tuesday, Sony unveiled a prototype electric SUV called the Vision-S 02. The vehicle is the second prototype from the company, following the Vision-S 01 electric car that was unveiled in 2020.
To show how serious the company might be about electric vehicles, Sony announced it had created a new business segment called Sony Mobility that will handle the vehicles under development.
“We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.
A new electric vehicle from Sony could come as technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is planning to launch an electric car by 2025 under the current name of Project Titan.
Unlike Apple that has been relatively quiet on the details of its planned electric vehicles, Sony has now shown off two prototypes and last year shared that it was working with partners that included NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:"

2022-01-06T14:46:23Z,Energy Stocks Have Kicked Off the New Year,"Equity index futures were mixed before the opening bell on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) the only index in the black. Stocks are looking to recover from yesterday’s selloff that was prompted by the FOMC Minutes release that revealed a much more hawkish Fed that wants to “normalize” its balance sheet.
After the announcement, the CME FedWatch Tool increased the probability of a March rate hike to 67.8% from 59.7% on Tuesday and 27.1% a month ago. The report also prompted a rally in the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX), which climbed 2.22%, and a 16.68% spike in the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index). The 10-year yield is up another 1.17% Thursday morning and is testing its highs from March of 2021.
At the same time yields and the VIX were rising on Wednesday, stocks started selling off particularly among growth stocks. The S&P 500 Pure Growth Index ($SP500PG) fell 3.81%. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was among those selling off, falling 4.59% and closing below its December lows. Semiconductors were also a big loser with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) falling 3.2%. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell more than 5%. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was able to swim upstream because the stock actually rose 1.47% on the day.
The major indices all fell, with the Nasdaq Composite ((COMP:GIDS)) falling the most at 3.34%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) fell the least, closing 1.07% lower. The S&P 500 (SPX) closed 1.94% lower and even closed below its 2021 Q4 highs. The inability to maintain those levels will likely be considered a bearish sign for many traders because the bulls were unable to hold support.
Investors went “risk-off” selling small-cap stocks, causing the Russell 2000 (RUT) to fall 3.30% and to give up much of its late December rally. Traders also sold cryptocurrencies with bitcoin falling more than 4%.
This morning, jobless claims came in higher than expected, but markets were unmoved on the number. Keep an eye on the VIX this morning because the sentiment indicator has ticked above 20. Investors may be concerned about the rising strength of the U.S. dollar. If the dollar continues to get stronger, it could hurt multinational companies because their products will be more expensive in foreign markets; this could decrease sales as foreign consumers look for cheaper alternatives.
A few earnings announcements are getting some stocks to move in premarket action. Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ: WBA) was up 2.78% in premarket trading after announcing better-than-expected earnings and revenue ..."

2022-02-06T16:42:50Z,"10 Most Searched Tickers On Benzinga In January: SPY, Tesla, Apple And More","Each trading day features hundreds of headlines and press releases about companies. Benzinga Pro is a source for traders to see the latest news on the overall market and also on individual tickers.
Here is a look at the stocks that were searched for the most on Benzinga Pro for the month of January.
1. SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY)

YTD Return: -4.6%
52-Week Range: $379.37 to $479.98
Price: $453.92

The S&P 500 themed ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro for the month of January. The ETF was the eighth most searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro. The ETF and S&P 500 Index serves as gauges for overall market strength and news, which could lead to an increase in searches for the ticker to find macros news and themes.
2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)

YTD Return: -11.9%
52-Week Range: $539.49 to $1243.49
Price: $889.49

The most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in all of 2021 comes in second place to start 2022. The electric vehicle giant had nearly as many searches as SPY in January, but came up just short. Tesla reported quarterly earnings in January, which likely helped with continued interest in the stock.
3. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)

YTD Return: -1.7%
52-Week Range: $116.21 to $182.94
Price: $174.23

Technology giant Apple was the third most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in January but had a wide gap from TSLA and SPY, with SPY searches nearly double that of AAPL. Like Tesla, ..."

2022-02-07T18:58:33Z,7 Of The Best Nasdaq Stocks to Buy On The Dip,"The S&P 500 is off to a shaky start to 2022, down 5.5% year-to-date. As bad as things have been for the S&P 500, they have been even worse for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is down 9.9% so far in this year.
Investors are dumping Nasdaq stocks due to concerns over rising interest rates, which negatively impact the valuation of growth stocks and unprofitable companies. But the rotation out of Nasdaq stocks has also created some buying opportunities for long-term investors willing to stomach the volatility.
Here are seven of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy, according to Bank of America.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Shares of iPhone maker Apple have held up relatively well so far in 2022, down just 2.4% year-to-date. Analyst Wamsi Mohan says Apple's robust cash flow provides defense for investors against a volatile market backdrop. Mohan is projecting a strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal 2023 driven by 5G upgrades that will enable more virtual reality and augmented reality applications. In addition, he says an increasing mix of high-margin Services segment growth will boost Apple's profitability and reduce its reliance on iPhone sales numbers.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $215 price target for AAPL stock.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Microsoft shares haven't fared as well as Apple so far in 2022, falling 9% year-to-date. Microsoft made major headlines in January when it announced a $68.7 billion buyout of video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI), Microsoft's largest acquisition in company history. The tech giant is clearly going all-in on gaming, but analyst Brad Sills says there are plenty of other reasons to like the stock, including its potential for accelerating ..."
2022-02-07T19:17:30Z,"Chart Wars: Between Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Which Stock Looks Set To Fly Higher?","NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) were each trading 1% higher on Monday despite the broad sector ETF SPDR S&P 500 consolidating with an inside bar pattern.
Both stocks have reached new all-time highs recently with Nvidia soaring to the $346.47 mark on Nov. 22 and Taiwan Semiconductor hitting a Jan. 13 high of $145. Since reaching their all-time highs both stocks have sold off, with Nvidia dropping 38.35% to reach a Jan. 28 low of $212.96 and on that same date Taiwan Semiconductors bounced up from a bottom at the 114.19 level, which represented a 21.25% decline.
While both semiconductor stocks have fallen lower, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductors have both printed reversal candles on their daily charts, which indicates higher prices may be on the horizon. Nvidia may have a potential political advantage, however, being a U.S. company because on Friday the U.S. House formally passed a China competition bill to increase chip production.
It should be noted, however, that events affecting the general markets, negative or positive reactions to earnings prints and news headlines about a stock can quickly invalidate patterns and breakouts. As the saying ..."

Notwithstanding the better-than-expected earnings report, the stock is pulling back sharply on Thursday.
The Nvidia Analysts: Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill maintained a Buy rating and a $400 price target on Nvidia shares.
Wells Fargo Securities analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Outperform rating and a $370 price target.
Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer reiterated an Outperform rating and a $400 price target.

Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated a Strong Buy rating and a $365 price target.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating and a $350 price target.
Needham Would Be Buyers Of Shares: Nvidia has excellent visibility into demand, especially on data center and supply, Gill said in a note. The analyst expects significant supply coming online in the second half of the year, helping ease constraints in gaming and data center.
Given the stock's 10% year-to-date drop and the 30% compression in forward multiple over the past month, the analyst said he would be a buyer of the stock.
Nvidia, Gill said, has one of the strongest financial profiles in the semiconductor industry with sales growth of 50% to 60% a year and a 47% operating margin and 70% year-over-growth in free cash flow.
Needham is excited about the ""burgeoning software opportunity"" for Nvidia. The company has developed three innovative software opportunities, namely Nvidia AI, Nvidia Omniverse and Nvidia Drive, the firm noted.

While some jump in blindly, others diligently do their research — and of course, there are those who land somewhere between those boundaries.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and Bridgewater Associates founder and co-Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio bought their first stocks before they were teenagers — and long before online trading platforms were around to make it easier to buy and sell stock or cryptocurrency.
Dalio Tees Off: Dalio bought his first shares when he was 12 years old in the late 1950s. He earned his money as a caddy at The Links Golf Club, saving enough to buy $300 worth of shares in Northeast Airlines, a Boston-based air carrier.
Why did he buy it? According to a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything,"" he had heard golfers talk about it, then his father, a jazz musician, introduced him to a broker who could help Dalio buy the stock.
""I bought it for the stupid reason that it was the only company I'd heard of that was selling for less than $5 a share, so I thought that if it went up, I would make more money,"" said Dalio. ""I got lucky because it was about to go bankrupt and then was acquired by another company, and then I was hooked on playing the market.""
(Howard Hughes acquired control of Northeast in 1962 which sent the stock price up; the airline merged with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) in 1972.)

2022-03-22T17:43:05Z,ESG Stocks And ETFs To Watch As SEC Weighs Greenhouse Gas Disclosure Requirement,"On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed that all publicly traded companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.
The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.

Zoltan Strikes Again
Premium subscribers will have another note from Credit Suisse's boy wonder Zoltan Pozsar to savor soon, but Izabella Kaminska, the former editor of the FT's Alphaville, offered a few excerpts and comments before taking her kid to school this morning in Europe. I've included her post in full below, followed by a look at our system's top names as of Thursday's close, which happen to include wheat, oil, and other commodity exposure. 
Authored by Izabella Kaminska of The Blind Spot
""You can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat”
There’s a new Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse report out… and he starts off by saying:
…you can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat.

I’m so glad because this rather obvious point seems to be completely missed by economists and analysts for unknown reasons.
Nor do they seem to get that just because the commodity market doesn’t match the scale of the bond or equity market that doesn’t mean it is not significantly more important for the world economy than anything else.
The way I explain it is that commodities are like the oxygen the body needs to stay alive. The lifeblood is all the other financial stuff.
You can give up a lot of blood and still keep living. But it doesn’t take a very large oxygen deficit to kill you.
Back to Zoltan (before Zerohedge and everyone else is over the report). Or should I say Z̶oltan and Z̶erohedge. (Though I’ve just noticed that striking through the Z makes it look like the Azov battalion symbol so that’s also no good. We are going to have to go with Soltan and Serohedge).
The key point is that Soltan is sticking to his guns about this being a paradigm shifting moment for finance.
And regarding that point that other economists don’t seem to understand (my emphasis):
Central banks are good at curbing demand, not at conjuring supply. Energy and commodities are needed for virtually everything, Russia exports everything, and unlike 1973, it’s not just the price of oil, but the price of everything that is surging. After laying dormant for decades, the fourth price of money is back with a vengeance – the par, basis, and FX-related prices of money are dormant at the moment, but the price level is about to become very volatile and the market is trying to price the price of future money (OIS), that is, the number of interest rate hikes and the FOMC adjusting the level of terminal rates (r*) in response to the new price level regime brought about by war and sanctions

When it comes to commodities Soltan has definitely done his homework. A really great point relates to the important role of shipping in the maintenance of global price equilibrium. If commodities are the oxygen, ships ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"
