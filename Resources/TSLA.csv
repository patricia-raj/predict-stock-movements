Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up more than 7% in premarket trading on news that the company delivered a record number of vehicles in the fourth quarter.

Another company rising in premarket trading is McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD).

RBC Hikes Q4 Estimates to Give Effect to Strong Deliveries:  Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries update came off as fireworks to close the year and start 2022, RBC analyst Spak said.
Citing the stronger-than-expected deliveries, the analyst raised his revenue estimate for the fourth quarter from $15.3 billion to $17.6 billion. Credits are expected at $275 million, and auto margins, excluding credits, are likely to come in at a record 29.7%, the analyst said. The adjusted EPS estimate for the quarter goes up from $2.09 to $2.81, he added.
Spak forecasts a free cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter.
RBC estimates 2022 deliveries of 1.24 million units and 2025 deliveries of 2.35 million units.
Morgan Stanley's 3 Key Thoughts:  Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries were roughly 15% ahead of the consensus and came before contribution from Gigafactory Austin and Gigafactory Berlin, which ultimately are likely to be far larger plants than Fremont and Shanghai, Morgan Stanley analyst Jonas said.

On this day 13 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and changed the world of cryptocurrency forever.
To celebrate the 13th birthday of Bitcoin, here are 13 fun facts about the cryptocurrency.
First Purchase: On May 22, 2010, history was made when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas from Papa John’s International (NASDAQ: PZZA). The purchase of the two pizzas became the first goods transacted with Bitcoin.
The pizzas cost around $41 at the time. The Bitcoin used to purchase the pizzas would be worth over $460 million today, based on the current price of the cryptocurrency. May 22 is celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day every year.
Ethereum Co-Founder Ties To Bitcoin: Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), took a side job in 2011 working for Bitcoin Weekly. As a writer, Buterin was paid 5 Bitcoin for each article written. Later that year, Buterin founded Bitcoin Magazine, where he was the lead writer.
Buterin launched the white paper for Ethereum in late 2013 and officially launched the cryptocurrency on July 30, 2015.

2022-01-04T14:29:57Z,Financial Stocks Could be Positioned to Kick Off the Q4 Earnings Season,"The U.S. dollar was rising against the Japanese yen Tuesday morning as foreign investors take notice of the jump in United States Treasury yields. The Japanese yen is now trading at a three-year low against the dollar. The U.S. dollar Index ($DXY) is working on a two-day rally against a basket of other currencies.
The falling yen prompted a rally in Japanese markets. The Nikkei 225 (N225:JP) rose 1.77% overnight. Japan hasn’t had the same inflationary problems as other countries, so the Bank of Japan is still pushing economic stimulus. If the yen continues to weaken, it could help the Nikkei 225 continue to gain ground.  
Equity index futures were trading higher before the bell as stocks hit the final official day of the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 futures (/ES) rose a quarter of a percent in premarket action. If investors follow through after the opening bell, the S&P 500 could be set to create another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) were also up 0.27% in premarket trading and looking to create a new all-time high too.
Energy stocks could lead other sectors again on Tuesday because crude oil futures (/CL) were also trading higher on Tuesday morning rising 1.13% in premarket trading. The commodity looks to be bouncing off an important support level. Consumer staples could also be set up for a good day because some of its companies are seeing analyst upgrades. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) was upgraded by Guggenheim from neutral to a buy. Yesterday, McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) was upgraded too.
Investors appear to be unconcerned about rising COVID-19 cases. According to data from John Hopkins University, more than 1 million more cases were reported on Monday. One reason the numbers were higher was because of a delay in reporting from some U.S. states. The Omicron variant continues to spread but the case doesn’t seem to be as severe as the Delta variant.
In fact, cruise line Carnival (NYSE: CCL) was among several travel and leisure stocks climbing in premarket trading. Travel and leisure have been among the hardest companies hit by COVID-19 because it has hit all workers including pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers, and more.  
The airline was able to influence a dispute between the United States government and AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) over the companies’ 5G plans and how they might affect airline safety. The telecom companies were providing an alternative plan. But after airline unions started speaking up over the safety issues, AT&T and Verizon decided to push ..."

(NASDAQ: TSLA) has opened a showroom in the capital of Xinjiang, the province where human rights advocates have accused the Chinese government of abuses against the Uyghur minority population.
What Happened: Tesla announced the opening of the dealership in a Dec. 31 post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo; the company did not make a similar announcement on any English-language social media site.
Human rights advocates have produced video evidence and testimony from Xinjiang detailing the Chinese government’s campaign against the Uyghurs and members of other Turkic Muslim minority groups. The government has set up internment camps in the region, and human rights groups have accused China of subjecting the camps’ prisoners to slave labor and severe birth control measures.
Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law banning most imports from Xinjiang, citing the use of forced labor in the region’s manufacturing facilities.

The JOLTS report also showed a decrease in job openings in November. The Great Resignation continues as the “quits” rate remained high. In the light of Wednesday’s ADP report, it may be that workers were simply quitting one job to take another job. Friday’s Employment Situation report could provide greater insights to these job market developments.
Many stocks turned bearish after the manufacturing and job opening announcements; the S&P 500 (SPX) was positioned for a new all-time high, but it turned negative ..."

“Generating more energy, not less, increases quality of life for all,” Dorsey tweeted with a nuclear power emoji.

2022-01-17T12:43:23Z,6 Companies That Could Fix Domestic Battery Supply Problem Using Little To No Emissions In The Mining of Essential Minerals,"It's said that a deficit in graphite and nickel could thwart EV production post-2022.
Contrary to popular belief, North American companies already have the power to begin domestic battery production, mining and processing essential minerals on U.S. and Canadian soil.
Genuinely ESG-friendly mining and mineral exploration companies are teaming up with heavy industrial equipment manufacturers to create all-electric mining and production equipment.
Companies are creating 100% carbon-free, off-grid power sources that would enable cleaner mining and exploration practices for a truly emissions-free production cycle.
Tesla is erring in applying for tariff-free imports from China, as opposed to accessing pure deposits just miles away.

When we talk about the essential elements of an electric vehicle battery, graphite — more often than not — seems to be left out of the conversation.
This changed recently when news got out that there may be a global graphite deficit, starting in 2022. This comes at a time when the industry is preparing for a major EV boom, and demand from the battery sector is expected to rise by 30% annually until 2030, as reported by Electrek.
The demand for domestic battery products may all be in vain unless something is done, otherwise, to save it. 
While making the point that China controls 84% of the global supply of graphite on this planet, OilPrice's Tom Kool notes that there are no domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. to supply automotive-grade graphite at scale; because graphite isn’t battery-ready straight out of the ground, it must be processed. 
While synthetic graphite production is possible, it’s nowhere nearly as affordable or environmentally-friendly as the original. This mean a broken supply chain must first be fixed in order for the global energy transition — that Goldman Sachs has dubbed the “great battery race” — to continue and for total electrification to thrive.
WWR And NMG Could Change The Game For Graphite In Domestic Battery Production
Graphite is a key element that forms the anode of lithium batteries. Without it, a trillion-dollar EV market ceases to exist. Without it, there’s no EV revolution, no carbon-free future and no reason to go “all in” on EV.
And while the supply chain has already been disrupted and companies are forging exclusive partnerships with producers overseas, this may simply not be true. In fact, three companies come to mind that negate this fact, and they’ve just been waiting for their time to shine. 
One company is Westwater Resources Inc. (NYSE: WWR), an explorer and developer of US-based mineral resources essential to clean energy production – including graphite. In 2018, the company purchased Alabama Graphite in order to expand its minerals list before going full-force into its new graphite production company in 2020 with the sale of its uranium assets in Texas and New Mexico to the enCore Energy Corp. 
The Coosa Graphite Project is known as one of “the most advanced graphite projects in the contiguous United States of America.” This year, Westwater Resources shared its plans to invest $202 million in order to develop a “one-of-a-kind” production facility that would allow the company to process graphite at a mass scale. 
By early 2023, the facility is expected to begin processing an estimated 8,050 metric tons of graphite concentrate per year. The company also anticipates raw material to be supplied from outside sources until at least 2028.
While there’s speculation that the global graphite market is extremely undervalued, in 2019, the entire market was said to be valued at $14.9 billion — and it’s expected to be valued at around $22 billion by 2027. But with countries adopting an all-electric future, it is likely to even exceed that, by far. 
According to OilPrice, “The average HEV needs up to 10 kgs of graphite. The average EV requires up to 70 kgs. A Tesla Model S needs even more. Every million EVs require around 75,000 tonnes of natural graphite.” 
Batteries contain almost 30% graphite — a third of the most essential materials included in an EV battery. When the demand for EVs begins soaring out of control, so will the demand and price for graphite, and the industry needs to be prepared. 
North of the U.S., Canada’s Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (NYSE: NMG)\ is making major waves in not just graphite but the mining industry in general. A battery materials company based out of Québec, Nouveau Monde believes that with a higher set of standards and a stronger emphasis on accountability, it’s possible to eliminate harmful emissions from the mining process and to ..."

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is surely looking to climb out of the hole her flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF (ARCA:ARKK), tumbled in 2021, but the Innovation ETF just keeps digging deeper. 
ARK's Innovation fund hit a new 52-week low on Friday when it fell below the $65 level. It's now down about 60% from its all-time high and it's already approaching a 30% decline in the first month of the year.
Despite its dramatic underperformance over the last year or so, the ARK Innovation ETF is still up about 60% over a three-year period and more than 210% over a five-year period.
The longer-term gains can be largely attributed to the outperformance of some of Wood's biggest positions. Here is a look at the top 5 holdings in the ARK Innovation ETF:
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 


Weighting: 8.07%


52-Week Range: $539.49 - $1,243.49


Current Price: $818.63


Wood may be most well-known for her early and consistent admiration of Tesla. A few months ago, the ARK Invest founder and CEO said her expectations for the stock continue to increase with Tesla's market share. Her base case is $3,000 per share, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed with, contingent upon the company's ability to ""execute really well.""

To use the feature, the vehicle should be travelling below 5.6 miles per hour, with no relevant moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists detected near the intersection, it added.

The selling dropped Alphabet down below its previous Nov. 19 all-time high of $3,037, which will now act as a resistance zone.

2022-02-04T13:25:34Z,2 Lesser-Known Stocks That Could Outperform Tesla In 2022,"A trait of a good investor is being able to select high-probability assets regardless of the asset name. This means having a proven analysis process that filters out the investment opportunities with the highest chance of returning a profit while staying 100% detached from the asset names. 
Venture online, and you will often see the usual suspects that budding investors and traders follow. This list includes:

Gamestop Corp. (NYSE: GME) 
Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) 
The EUR-USD
Gold 
Oil
Tons of penny stocks 
And Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 

A portfolio that performs consistently requires rebalancing periodically. This involves understanding when to let go of assets that are not performing, either in profit or loss, and adding new assets that are now displaying an edge. 
An edge is when an asset has set up to offer more chance of returning a profit or a loss. For us as busy everyday people, the simplest and quickest way to define an edge is using technical analysis on the higher timeframes. This allows us to do less work but make more profit by holding and compounding, a process that also fits well around our busy lifestyles without any compromise on time and profit. 
I have broken down how I define my edge using a simple checklist system that you can read here.

The bull flag pattern is created with a sharp rise higher forming the pole, which is then followed by a consolidation pattern that brings the stock lower between a channel with parallel lines.

For bearish traders, the ""trend is your friend"" (until it's not) and the stock may continue downwards within the following channel for a short period of time. Aggressive traders may decide to short the stock at the upper trendline and exit the trade at the lower trendline.
Bullish traders will want to watch for a break up from the upper descending trendline of the flag formation, on high volume, for an entry. When a stock breaks up from a bull flag pattern, the measured move higher is equal to the length of the pole and should be added to the lowest price within the flag.

He describes himself as a “contrarian investor” and his views are widely followed by those that are typically bullish on the cryptocurrency space but, at the same time, he has been accused of being a scammer and worse by the so-called Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) maximalists.
Mr. Whale in an exclusive conversation with Benzinga offered clarity on his views surrounding different aspects of the cryptocurrency space, including on how the communities backing the apex coin and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) differ.
About Mr. Whale: Mr. Whale is an anonymous source of cryptocurrency insights who also runs a notable blog on Medium. He has amassed more than 420,000 followers on Twitter.
“The main purpose of my Twitter page is to provide the crypto community with a realistic, honest, and contrarian voice that goes against the moon boys and maximalists,” said Mr. Whale in an exchange with Benzinga.

“My account has grown substantially over the last several months, ranking me as one of the largest crypto accounts in the world.”
A factor that helped Mr. Whale’s popularity on Twitter was Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who posted “indeed” as a reply to one of his tweets last year. In that tweet, Mr. Whale posted a stinging critique of Bitcoiners venting their frustration at Musk after the latter said the apex cryptocurrency was not environmentally friendly.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) continued to be haunted by recalls, but CEO Elon Musk  scored a victory in his pursuit of an endorsement from President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, the Chinese EV trio listed in the U.S. found themselves amid the news headlines.
Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week:
Tesla Recalls More Vehicles, Biden Finally Spells Out Tesla:  Tesla had at least 2 recalls announced this week – the first one to fix a software error that could affect windshield defrosting and the second one due to a Boombox function that allows drivers to play sounds over an external speaker that can affect audible warnings for pedestrians.

Both stocks have struggled to rebound back toward their all-time highs although Nio has notably had a tougher year, currently trading down 62% from its Jan. 8, 2021 all-time high of $66.99 compared to Tesla, which has lost about 26% from its all-time high of $1,243.49 printed on Nov. 4 of that same year.
Although Tesla has already established itself as the largest producer of electric vehicles, its market share will be challenged as more brands continue to secure their place within the sector. Smart money has also begun to position itself into Nio recently, which demonstrates investors may believe the China-based EV manufacturer has more room to trade higher.
It should be noted, however, that events affecting the general markets, negative or positive reactions to earnings prints and news headlines about a stock can quickly invalidate patterns and breakouts. As the saying goes, ""the trend is your friend until it isn’t"" and any trader in a position should have a clear stop set in place and manage their risk versus reward.

A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart.
The lower lows indicate the bears are in control, while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify a downtrend, with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend and descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term downtrend.
A stock often signals when the lower low is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bullish engulfing or hammer candlestick. Likewise, the lower high could be signaled when a doji, gravestone or dragonfly candlestick is printed. Moreover, the lower lows and lower highs often take place at resistance and support levels.
In a downtrend the ""trend is your friend"" until it’s not and in a downtrend, there are ways for both bullish and bearish traders to participate in the stock:

2022-02-26T13:00:36Z,EXCLUSIVE: Crypto-Focused YouTube Talk Show Host Steven Steele On Building An Audience,"The YouTube-based cryptocurrency talk show ""Steven Steele Live"" is celebrating its first anniversary online. Benzinga recently visited with Steven Steele to discuss his unique role as an independent online crypto-focused media star and his views on the state of the digital assets environment.
Q: You are observing your first anniversary of “Steven Steele Live.” What inspired you to go on YouTube to discuss cryptocurrency?
Steven Steele: It was all kind of an accident, really. I've been an investor for quite a while, and then I started looking at other content out there the more involved that I got with my investments over the last few years. And then a few people started asking me to come on as a guest panelist on their shows.
Then I realized that there really wasn't the kind of show out there that I would like to see for myself. So that's when I began filling a void, as I saw it, and while doing something I genuinely enjoy.
Q: You have a show business background, but have you ever done this type of production before?
Steven Steele: I do have a bit of a background in voiceover work, and I used to make my living as a recording artist – as a frontman of a band, so I used to do a lot of touring and things like that. Perhaps a combo between those things landed me in the role.

Q: What's the first year on YouTube been like for you? 
Steven Steele: It's been a super, super interesting journey – definitely one of the most interesting things I've ever embarked on.
The community that I've been able to build is not the biggest channel, by any means, but the community that I've been able to build has been exceptional and unique. In fact, Jesse Hughes, the frontman of the Eagles of Death Metal, is a big fan of the show.
Another thing that makes the community that I built through the channel more unique than perhaps other crypto centric channels is everybody's very familiar with each other. And everyone's really, really dialed in – not only through their interest in cryptocurrencies, but friendships as well. Overall, I think it's been a very, very rewarding experience.
Q: The major of the mainstream business media ..."

Each of the high-flying stocks that are spread across six of Ark Invest’s exchange-traded funds is down in the range of 23% to 55% so far this year.

2022-03-14T15:38:06Z,Will China's Supply Chain Issues Cause Problems For The Fed This Week?,"This post contains sponsored advertising content. This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice.
(Monday Market Open) Geopolitical risks are bearing down on the markets as a new week of trading is about to kick off. Equity index futures were much higher overnight but have significantly trimmed those gains. In fact, the Nasdaq futures were up about 100 points but turned negative before the open.
Investors had reasons for positivity with news that virtual peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have seen progress. Russia may be seeing pressure from various places. Over the weekend, there were reports of Russia getting low on munitions and seeking help from China; however, China has denied the report. Additionally, Russia may be at risk of defaulting on debt payments as the ruble has weakened significantly and much of Russia’s assets are tied up in sanctions.  
Numerous commodities are pulling back on the news around the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Crude oil was down about 4% before the opening bell. Natural gas was down 1.61%. And RBOB gasoline was down 2.7%. Other commodities that have been directly related to Russia are also falling in premarket action. Palladium futures were down 7.48%, and wheat was down 2.94%.
However, the news that appears to be more directly related to the equity markets today is coming out of China. A surge in Covid-19 cases has caused China to institute more lockdowns in Shenzhen and other cities. China is experiencing its worst outbreak since the pandemic started in 2020. The news caused the Hang Seng Index to fall 4.97% and the Shanghai composite to drop 2.6%.
The lockdowns are renewing issues with supply chains. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL
) is one company that could get hit hard. Six of Apple’s suppliers, including Foxconn, have had to halt production due to the lockdowns. Volkswagen and Toyota (NYSE: TM) have also had to halt production in their factories in the region. The problems aren’t just manufacturing-related. Hong Kong fears that food supply disruptions could hurt the city-island because it imports 90% of its food. Consumers have already seen shortages in foreign import goods.
The news in China could complicate the picture for the Federal Reserve, which is expected to meet this week to determine interest rates. Because the Fed can’t do much to control or help with supply chains, the market is still expecting the Fed to raise rates just a quarter of a point. The Fed has a tough job in trying to address inflation that has been rising at a 40-year record pace and not crushing an economy struggling with numerous issues, like the supply chain and war in Ukraine.

2022-03-14T20:25:44Z,Dogecoin Bulls And Bears Enter Fierce Battle After Elon Musk Hodls,"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) spiked almost 10% higher just after midnight on Sunday after Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) he had no plans to sell his stake in the Shiba Inu-themed crypto, nor his position in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).
The surge was short lived and by Monday midafternoon Dogecoin was trading flat to Sunday’s 24-hour closing price.

2022-03-16T15:09:45Z,Nio Reverses Course After Sell-Off: Will EV Stock Rally Ahead Of Earnings?,"After an extended lean run, Nio, Inc. (NYSE: NIO) shares hit a trough Tuesday, weighed down by multiple factors. It appears the selling may have stalled, at least for now.
The Backdrop For Nio:  Nio shares have been tracing a downward trend since it peaked at $66.99 on Jan. 9, 2021. The weakness reflected production disruption that was precipitated by supply constraints. Nio fell 35% in 2021, underperforming its domestic peers as well as most U.S. EV stocks.
Given the  multiple product launches planned for 2022,  it was widely expected that Nio would recover from its predicament in the new year. But it was not to be. Fears of a string of Fed rate hikes, and later on the start of the Ukraine war, sapped the risk appetite of the market. Nio was also caught in the vortex of the market-wide selloff, led by tech stocks.
Ahead of Wednesday's session, Nio shares had lost a whopping 53% year-to-date.

2022-03-22T17:43:05Z,ESG Stocks And ETFs To Watch As SEC Weighs Greenhouse Gas Disclosure Requirement,"On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed that all publicly traded companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.
The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ..."

What Happened: Musk’s former partner Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, shared details of how frugal Musk is with his money.

“The Mars project is hard. There’s no income for it,” Grimes said. “There’s no way for it to make money.”
Grimes said that Musk is not hoarding money as some believe due to his massive wealth reported by the media. Much of that wealth is tied to equity in Tesla and SpaceX.
“It’s for the benefit of humanity, and it’s dangerous and it’s expensive, and people are like ‘he’s hoarding money.’ No he’s spending everything on R&D.”
Despite being worth $235 billion and being ranked as the richest person in the world by Bloomberg, Grimes said the majority of Musk’s money is helping fund operations like SpaceX and plans to colonize Mars.

The Tesla Analyst: Ives has maintained an Outperform rating and a $1,400 a share price target on the Elon Musk-led company’s stock.
The Tesla Thesis: In January, Ives estimated Tesla could likely reach 1.5 million unit volume in 2022 despite the lingering supply chain issues. 
The analyst said he sees unit deliveries are “trending well ahead of Street expectations.” 
“We believe China and Europe in particular are tracking at least 15%+ ahead of Street estimates and combined with U.S. Model Y-driven strength Tesla could now be on a 2 million unit run-rate exiting 2022.”

The two-day tight trading ranges have caused Tesla to develop a double inside bar pattern on the daily chart. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend.
An inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar and each is called an ""inside bar.""

2022-03-25T20:07:29Z,Will Rising Metal Prices Drag Tesla Stock?,"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently hiked the prices of its more affordable Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs  in the U.S. and China.
Although the company did not disclose any specific reason for the increases, raw material cost inflation exacerbated by geopolitical tension may have been the culprit.
EV-ICE Price Parity Could Be Delayed:  One of the premises behind the thesis of wider electric vehicle adoption is the ability of green energy vehicles to attain price parity with internal combustion vehicles. The timeframe for achieving this is likely to be pushed out, given abounding macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.
Even ahead of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, battery manufacturers began raising prices, blaming the action on the higher cost of cathode, anode and the other raw materials that go into batteries. The crisis in Eastern Europe that intensified last month has indiscriminately pushed up metal prices due to fears of a supply squeeze.
Earlier, it was assumed that price parity will be achieved by 2028 in a bear case scenario and by 2025 in a bull case scenario, according to BloombergNEF. Now, with all the uncertainties and supply chain shocks, the schedule could be pushed back.
Geopolitical Tensions Put Tesla's LiFP Bet At Risk:  Tesla initially used batteries with nickel-cobalt-aluminum chemistry manufactured at its Nevada Gigafactory for its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles sold in North America.
Late last year, the company said it will embrace the  lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFP) battery chemistry  with prismatic cells as opposed to the cylindrical cells in the older chemistry.

Here's What One Study Predicts And Who Could Be The Youngest,"Elon Musk saw his wealth soar in 2021 with the rising price of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares and the private valuation given to SpaceX. At one point in 2021, Musk was worth as much as all the MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL teams combined.
Here’s a look at how quickly Musk could become a trillionaire and if he is on pace to be the first to hit this new status.
Who Could Be First Trillionaire?: John D. Rockefeller became the first billionaire in the world in 1916. Rockefeller was the founder of Standard Oil, an oil giant that was later split due to antitrust concerns.
Standard Oil is now represented by Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), BP plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), which all own pieces of Rockefeller's former company. 
It took another 83 years before someone passed the $100 billion wealth mark: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
There are now nine centibillionaires with several of them having a shot at hitting the trillion-dollar wealth level.

What Happened: Sticker prices of used ID.4 electric crossover, which competes with Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) more expensive Model Y compact crossover, and Ford Motor Co’s (NYSE: F) Mustang Mach-E are more than the new ones.
Volkswagen started shipping the ID.4 that it currently makes in Zwickau, Germany in February 2021. The plant in Europe is currently facing wiring harnessing shortages and had to reportedly halt production last month for four days due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“In terms of EVs, most new models cost more than used at this time. There is one exception, the Volkswagen ID.4 which costs about $808 above MSRP nationally,” Henry Hoenig, data journalist at Jerry, told Benzinga.

The interest in Rock has led to a surge in ticket prices and additional show dates added, making comedy venues and ticket resellers the big winners from the incident at the Academy Awards.
What Happened: Rock was slapped by actor Will Smith at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday, March 27, 2022.

Here's What to Expect When Tesla, Nio, XPeng And Li Auto Report Q1 Deliveries","Electric vehicle makers are navigating through some serious supply chain challenges. Deliveries statistics for March as well as the first quarter are key to gauging their resilience in the face of these shocks.
Will Tesla's China Shutdown Mar Q1?  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) will release its first-quarter deliveries and production data over the next few days. The company finished 2021 on a strong note, having delivered 936,172 vehicles for the year. The average quarterly pace works out to 234,043 units.

They want education, information and easy back-and-forth communication with their financial services providers and embedded networks, as well as access.
That’s according to Nikki Varanasi the CEO and founder at Staax, a Techstars- and Western Union Co (NYSE: WU)-backed fintech building the first social, investment-based peer-to-peer payments platform.
Consumers want more than a “Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) meets Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ: HOOD),” she explained in her conversation with Benzinga on building transparent financial ecosystems targeted at younger demographics.
“They also don’t want to go on any Fidelity, E-Trade, or Robinhood and make their own decisions. They don’t know where to start.”

Zoltan Strikes Again
Premium subscribers will have another note from Credit Suisse's boy wonder Zoltan Pozsar to savor soon, but Izabella Kaminska, the former editor of the FT's Alphaville, offered a few excerpts and comments before taking her kid to school this morning in Europe. I've included her post in full below, followed by a look at our system's top names as of Thursday's close, which happen to include wheat, oil, and other commodity exposure. 
Authored by Izabella Kaminska of The Blind Spot
""You can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat”
There’s a new Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse report out… and he starts off by saying:
…you can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat.

I’m so glad because this rather obvious point seems to be completely missed by economists and analysts for unknown reasons.
Nor do they seem to get that just because the commodity market doesn’t match the scale of the bond or equity market that doesn’t mean it is not significantly more important for the world economy than anything else.
The way I explain it is that commodities are like the oxygen the body needs to stay alive. The lifeblood is all the other financial stuff.
You can give up a lot of blood and still keep living. But it doesn’t take a very large oxygen deficit to kill you.
Back to Zoltan (before Zerohedge and everyone else is over the report). Or should I say Z̶oltan and Z̶erohedge. (Though I’ve just noticed that striking through the Z makes it look like the Azov battalion symbol so that’s also no good. We are going to have to go with Soltan and Serohedge).
The key point is that Soltan is sticking to his guns about this being a paradigm shifting moment for finance.
And regarding that point that other economists don’t seem to understand (my emphasis):
Central banks are good at curbing demand, not at conjuring supply. Energy and commodities are needed for virtually everything, Russia exports everything, and unlike 1973, it’s not just the price of oil, but the price of everything that is surging. After laying dormant for decades, the fourth price of money is back with a vengeance – the par, basis, and FX-related prices of money are dormant at the moment, but the price level is about to become very volatile and the market is trying to price the price of future money (OIS), that is, the number of interest rate hikes and the FOMC adjusting the level of terminal rates (r*) in response to the new price level regime brought about by war and sanctions

When it comes to commodities Soltan has definitely done his homework. A really great point relates to the important role of shipping in the maintenance of global price equilibrium. If commodities are the oxygen, ships ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

Yet, Musk watchers recalled on March 24 he began to query and poll his 80 million-plus Twitter followers about their opinion of the platform’s algorithms, suggesting they should be open-sourced. Musk did not mention at the time he acquired his stake in the company.
Musk often gives the impression of someone who plays by his own roles, to the occasional chagrin of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But was there anything inappropriate — or worse — in the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) chief putting those questions and polls out to his followers?

According to the report, global government debt jumped 7.8% in 2021 to $65.4 trillion, while debt servicing costs dropped to $1.01 trillion, an effective interest rate of just 1.6%.

The report revealed that the teens are also increasingly concerned about the Russian war in Ukraine and less preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic.

(Wednesday Market Open) Equity index futures are pointing to a lower open as investor nervousness increases on comments made by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. While the Fed’s hawkishness is causing concern, several developments overseas pushed the S&P 500 index futures lower and led Deutsche Bank to predict a recession in 2023.
Potential Market Movers
Starting in China, another increase COVID-19 cases took the country to a new record, and now the Chinese government is extending lockdowns in Shanghai. According to The Wall Street Journal, more than 80% of daily cases were in Shanghai, and the government is requiring millions of people to stay in their homes. As we’ve learned over the last two years, lockdowns result in lost production, clogged supply chains, and supply shortages.
The Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and the SZSE Component Index fell 1.87% and 0.45% respectively. However, the SSE Composite was about even on the day. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) led the slide on the Asian exchanges, trading lower at 2.14% and 2.82% in pre-market action in the United States.
European markets were also trading lower after a couple of bad economic announcements and comments from European Central Bank (ECB) members. The European Union reported a 1.1% increase in its Producer Price Index (PPI) in February and a staggering 31.4% increase year-over-year. The biggest driver of the increase in the PPI was energy costs, which rose a stunning 87.2%, thanks in large part to the war in Ukraine.
The rising costs are obviously being felt by consumers and businesses, resulting in a slowdown in construction. The United Kingdom reported a higher-than-expected increase in its Construction PMI, reflecting the higher cost of inputs in that country.   
ECB members were active on Wednesday talking to the press and giving speeches. The Italian representative Fabio Panetta said the ECB wouldn’t hesitate to tighten its policy to curb inflation. However, the ECB is behind the curve as the Bank of England (BoE) has already been raising its key rate. Luis De Guindos, the Vice-President of the ECB, went a different direction saying that the key to the inflation problem would be to speed up and increase green energy initiatives.  
Europe isn’t getting any help from the war in Ukraine, as it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t ready to stop. Russia continues to attack Ukraine’s steel and grain facilities, adding to the current commodity problems. European Union (EU) leaders are now considering a ban on Russian coal which could add to the EU’s energy problems.
With all of these developments, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) analysts are now forecasting a recession in the United States and Europe in 2023. DB is the first major bank to forecast a recession, even though talk about a recession as increased in recent weeks. The analysts are also concerned that inflation will become unanchored and out of control.

Over the past couple of weeks, the art of communication was equal parts Impressionist, Abstract and Realist in regard to the linguistic pas de deux performed by the leadership of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk when the latter bought himself a seat on the social media giant’s board of directors.
Who’s The Boss? Prior to Monday’s surprise announcement that Musk acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the largest individual shareholder, new attention was given to Musk’s tweets from previous days about adding an edit button for Twitter users and insisting that because “Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.”
Twitter’s communications team went into overdrive to offer none-too-subtle reminders that Musk’s new role as director would not extend beyond the boardroom in to the C-suite. In regard to the edit button, the company told its users it was “working on an edit feature since last year,” adding with a winking emoji that “no, we didn’t get the idea from a poll” – a facetious but still unsubtle cue to all interested parties that Musk was not calling the shots on Twitter features.

What Happened: Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a passive investor must file a 13G disclosing a 5% or more stake in a company within 10 days of acquiring the stake. The original document Musk filed on April 4 shows the stake was acquired by March 14. That's 21 days between when Musk acquired the stake and when he disclosed it.
Under Sections 13(d), 13(g) and 16(a) of the act, the SEC can fine individuals for failing to file the documents within the imposed timeframes.

Filing Error? On Monday morning, Musk disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter via a 13G filing. The 13G form is meant for investors who are taking a passive stake in a company without exerting any influence over the company's business.
Following the initial filing, Twitter and its CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk has been appointed to Twitter's board of directors, suggesting Musk's role with Twitter will be far from passive. Musk subsequently re-filed the disclosure of his ownership stake on form 13D on Tuesday to reflect his status as an active investor. The updated filing also disclosed 371,900 fewer shares in his Twitter stake than the original filing indicated. Musk later tweeted that the ""initial share number filed was incorrect.""

For the star-struck members of our reading office, here are five unlikely celebrities who transitioned from the stage and screen stardom to the corporate boardroom.
Joan Crawford: The glamorous Oscar-winning star became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, the forerunner of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) in 1955 when she married the company’s president, Alfred Steele. Upon Steele’s death in 1959, she was elected to fill his seat on the corporate board.
While some people might associate Crawford’s board service with the crass low-comedy depiction from the infamous film “Mommie Dearest,” in reality Crawford was one of the hardest working directors in the company’s history, traveling extensively to promote the Pepsi product line and making endless appearances at the company’s offices and facilities around the country while appearing in promotional films. Crawford’s celebrity would generate extensive media coverage on her Pepsi-based travels, bringing an extraordinary wave of free publicity for the company’s beverages.

Benzinga spoke with founder and CEO Binu Girija to learn more about the company’s $10 million fundraising via a SAFE note led by Agnus Capital, as well as visions for the future.
Benzinga: Nice to meet you Binu. Care to start off with an introduction?
Binu Girija: I’m one of the co-founders of Way.com. We started in 2015 and, prior to that, I had a couple of startups.
Some of them failed while others I exited. It was, overall, a great experience and I’m starting to see some lights at the end of the tunnel with this fourth venture.
That said, we’re making cars affordable for everyone.
I think most people don’t know that they spend nearly $9,000 on car expenditures every year. If you look at the U.S. national average, salaries come in at around $32,000.

What we’re doing is we are trying to cut down the expenses on cars. We’re making mobility affordable, rewarding and fully digital.

What may be lost in the news is that Twitter is working on growing its Twitter Blue subscription offering and could bring an edit button to the platform with or without Musk.
What Happened: For years, Twitter users have begged for an edit button, a way to fix spelling or grammatical errors in published tweets.

2022-04-13T14:27:01Z,Stock Wars: Twitter Vs. Meta Platforms,"Benzinga’s weekly Stock Wars matches up two leaders in a major industry sector with the goal of determining which company is the better investment.
This week, the duel is between the two titans of the social media sector: Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: FB).
The Case For Twitter: This microblogging site was launched in 2006 as an internal service for the aggregator site Odeo. A New York University undergraduate student named Jack Dorsey was credited for coming up with the idea for Twitter, which first caught the public imagination at the 2007 SXSW conference in Austin. The company conducted its initial public offering (IPO) in 2013.
Few online platforms have made such a profound impact on daily communications as Twitter, which has reshaped the basic tenets of news broadcasting, political messaging, B2C and B2B marketing, community building among like-minded people, and the spread of joy, solemnity and malice by the most famous and least known of the planet.

Over the past week, Twitter has been at the center of the headlines when it was revealed that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk became the largest shareholder in the company. Musk has amassed 81 million followers on Twitter and has been a vocal commentator on what he perceived as its vices.
Tesla invited Musk to join the company’s board of directors, albeit with certain caveats including a Q&A session with the company’s workforce, but he declined the offer. The future of Musk’s relationship with the company remains to be seen, but CEO Parag Agrawal seemed pessimistic that Musk would remain a passive observer when he said, “There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged. The decisions we make is in our hands and no one else’s. Let’s tune out the noise, and stay focused on the work and what we’re building.”
In its most recent earnings report, the fourth-quarter data published on Feb. 10, Twitter reported revenue of $1.56 billion, up from $1.28 billion one year earlier, with operating income of $167 million and an 11% operating margin versus operating income of $252 million and a 20% operating margin in the same period of the previous year. The company’s basic earnings per share was 23 cents in the fourth quarter of 2021, down from 28 cents one year before. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2022, the company forecasted total revenue to be between $1.17 billion and $1.27 billion, with a GAAP operating loss to be between $225 million and $175 million.
Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal used the fourth-quarter earnings call to observe that while Twitter’s advertising revenue totaled $1.41 ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

2022-04-15T13:59:55Z,Lessons For Elon Musk: 5 Notorious Failed Hostile Takeovers,"As any student of industry knows, Elon Musk is hardly the first person to attempt a hostile takeover. But while the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) chieftain’s $54.20 per share bid for Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) continues to resonate, let’s pause to consider earlier attempts at hostile takeovers by well-respected and well-financed entities and individuals that — to ransack some Musk-worthy clichés — took off like a rocket ship but eventually vanished like a wisp of blunt smoke.
Hewlett Packard’s Failed Takeover of PricewaterhouseCooper: In September 2000, HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) sought to expand its technology advisory services by acquiring PwC’s consultancy unit for $18 billion.
But two months after making its unsolicited bid, HP abruptly walked away after failing to secure any common ground with PwC. HP Chairwoman and CEO Carly Fiorina lamented that because of “the current market environment, we are no longer confident that we can satisfy our value creation and employee retention objectives — and I am unwilling to subject the HP organization to the continuing distraction of pursuing this acquisition any further.”
Two years later, HP’s executives received a surprise call from PwC. It seemed that HP’s rival IBM (NYSE: IBM) was making a bid for PwC’s consulting unit for $3.5 billion, a considerably lower sum than HP offered, and PwC wanted to see if HP was interested in picking up from where it was previously disconnected. Juergen Rottler, vice-president of marketing of strategy and alliances at HP Services, told ComputerWeekly.com that HP was not eager to pick up where it left off.
""I don't know the exact number and talks never really got down to that level, but it was in the same ballpark as what IBM is offering,"" he said.

2022-04-19T16:10:11Z,Analysis: Will The Real Elon Musk Please Stand Up?,"Within the course of a week, the world witnessed two very different versions of Elon Musk.
On April 7, there was Musk basking in the glory of the opening of Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) new manufacturing facility in Austin — an event dubbed the “Cyber Rodeo” that brought the world’s media to Musk’s stage. The Tesla chief executive owned the spotlight while wearing a ten-gallon cowboy hat and dark aviator sunglasses, strutting with self-assurance as he launched his latest supersized endeavor — the new plant was not just any factory, but a Gigafactory.
This was the Musk that 82 million followers on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) have come to adore: brash, bold, larger-than-life, the living-breathing personification of the corporate world’s answer to a rock star, glowing in an aura that was further gold-plated by the news from earlier in the week that he acquired a 9.1% share of Twitter, making him the social media platform’s largest shareholder.
But then, there was another Musk one week later on April 14 who sitting awkwardly on a TED Talk stage while Chris Anderson pitched the softest of softball questions regarding his convoluted duet with Twitter, which by that time had devolved into a hostile takeover pursuit after he rejected an invitation to join the company’s board of directors and speak with the Twitter workforce in an unscripted Q&A session. The brash and bold cowboy-Musk of one week earlier was replaced with a somewhat disheveled, clearly uncomfortable man whose answers ranged from defensive to evasive to cryptic.
But Musk has always been something of a Rorschach test for those who consider him: some see the epitome of the can-do spirit that fuels the popular concept of the traditional American success story, while others see a problematic personality whose words and actions too frequently race down parallel tracks. With his attempted takeover of Twitter, the two sides of Musk have rotated in a simultaneous orbit around public scrutiny, with his supporters cheering on one side of his personality and his detractors magnifying the other.
See Also: 'If Elon Musk Wants To Buy Twitter, He Will': So Here's How To Trade It
On The One Hand: Few people would discount Musk’s genius for engineering, both from a high-tech perspective and an emotional marketing pursuit. He deserves credit for expanding the electric vehicle sector from a fringe element of the automotive industry into a key focus that has reshaped how car manufacturers are aiming to the future. And his breakthroughs in rocketry via SpaceX have inspired a wave of attention to the space program not seen since the halcyon days of the Apollo missions.
Furthermore, Musk has surfed the zeitgeist with his unbridled enthusiasm over cryptocurrency, particularly Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) — arguably, no other high-profile person has done more to elevate that digital asset from its origins as a lame joke into a level of serious investment consideration. And the crypto crowd’s adoration of Musk is so intense that very few bother to acknowledge Musk has refused to enable crypto acquisitions of his Tesla vehicles.
Musk is also the very rare corporate executive who doesn’t self-quarantine in the proverbial corner office. Through his Twitter page, he has conducted a dialogue with the public — or, to be more accurate, he has conducted a running commentary with occasional acknowledgments to Twitter denizens who ..."

2022-04-19T20:40:40Z,Could Starlink Go Public Via SPAC? Rumors Of Palihapitiya Deal Increase,"Retail investors love a good story for stocks, as well as love the opportunity to get into some potential growth stories on the ground floor. SPACs were one of the hottest stories in 2020 and 2021 but have fallen out of favor with many companies trading well below the $10 price after mergers have been completed.
Could a SPAC deal involving two of the biggest names bring life back to SPACs and how many coincidences do there have to be before it's considered research?
What Happened: During the height of SPACs, something often done by retail traders was connecting the dots between potential acquisition targets. This included seeing connections between board members, investments by the sponsors previously and even tracking where private jets were headed. The effect is now spilling over to two SPACs from a popular name in the space.
Chamath Palihapitiya was considered one of the biggest players in the SPAC industry for years but has gone relatively quiet and has also seen the value fall for the companies he took public. Could a deal with one of the biggest private companies revive him as a top name in SPAC land?
The Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp IV (NYSE: IPOD) and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp VI (NYSE: IPOF) are two of the most well-known SPACs and were part of a string of six SPACs with the IPO name in the ticker launched by Palihapitiya.
Recent chatter has been picking up online that the two SPACs could combine and help bring Starlink public. Starlink is the satellite unit owned by SpaceX, a company run by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which was valued at $100 billion last year.
Disclosure: The author is long shares IPOD, IPOF and SPCE.

Here’s how shares of the company have performed since co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down.
What Happened: Jack Dorsey served as the CEO of Twitter on two occasions in moves that parallel the storyline of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs.
Dorsey was the CEO of Twitter before being forced out by the board of directors in 2008, a move similar to what Jobs faced at Apple.
Dorsey was named the interim CEO in June 2015 in a move to bring the struggling company back to life. Later in October 2015, Dorsey received the official CEO title, a position he held until November 2021.
After six years of leading the company he co-founded, Dorsey announced on November 29, 2021, he would be stepping down as the CEO of Twitter.

(Friday Market Open) Another day, another round of earnings reports. However, the dark cloud of rising interest rates appears to be hanging over investors as equity index futures point to a lower open. Even the “happiest place on earth” is facing another storm.
Potential Market Movers
Disney (DIS) has lost ground after revelations from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) that its streaming service had lost subscribers and expects to lose many more. Now, the Florida legislature has voted to end Disney’s 50-year-old special self-governing district by June 1, 2023. The self-governing district allowed Disney to collect taxes, provide emergency services, and build new structures without local government approval. However, according to CNBC, the move may result in Florida taxpayers absorbing a $1 billion bond debt. There’s also the question of whether Florida will now be entitled to the additional tax revenue that the special Disney district was collecting as well as building and permit fees. Obviously, there’s a lot more to come on this story and how it will  affect Disney going forward.
While Disney is dealing with its own issues, the rest of the market will likely be undergoing another revaluation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s more hawkish tone on Thursday caused stocks to fall and yields to rise. On the bright side, the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) was down about 16 basis points in premarket trading which may take some of the sting out of valuation calculations.
The dreary outlook is even affecting companies with otherwise positive earnings reports. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reported that it hit analysts’ earnings estimates on the nose and saw better-than-expected revenues, but still fell 1.6% in pre-market trading. VZ issued forward guidance at the lower end of its fiscal 2022 range. The lower guidance came as VZ cut its sales forecast and reported struggles with inflation. One problem Verizon is likely expecting is that budget-conscious consumers will likely be looking for cheaper carrier plans as inflation pushes tighter household purse strings.
American Express (NYSE: AXP) was also trading lower despite beating on top and bottom-line numbers. AXP was down about 1% before the market open when the company failed to raise its earnings outlook and only reaffirmed previous guidance.  
Despite higher gold prices, Newmont (NYSE: NEM) missed on earnings and revenue estimates due to higher extraction and production costs. The company added an additional 5% for costs in its 2022 outlook. Management effectiveness is key in a time of rising input costs, which means NEM managers need to find a way to cut costs elsewhere if possible. Newmont was down 4.1% in premarket trading, adding to its Thursday loss of 6.7%.
One company that appears to be managing costs while benefiting from higher commodity prices is Schlumberger (NYSE: SL). Not only did the company beat ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

The stock’s comparative strength is likely due to Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s tender offer to acquire Twitter for $46.5 billion, which was revealed through a series of SEC documents dated April 20 but released on Thursday.
Thursday’s news helped Twitter to close the trading session up slightly and on Friday, the rise caused the stock to print a higher high to confirm an uptrend.
An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.
The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. 
Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages, such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages, which indicate the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages, such as the 200-day simple moving average, indicate a long-term uptrend.

A descending trendline acts as a resistance level and indicates there are more sellers than buyers even though the price continues to fall. When a stock or crypto breaks up from the trendline, it indicates a large reversal may be on the horizon.

2022-04-26T14:56:30Z,Analysis: Will Elon Musk's Twitter Kowtow To Chinese Communist Party Influence?,"When Elon Musk first notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about his desire to take over Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and turn it into a privately-held company, he stated, “I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”
Musk did not give details on how he would “unlock” the “extraordinary potential” at Twitter, which was founded in 2006, nor did he offer a hint of his concept of “free speech” — contrary to popular opinion, the First Amendment doesn’t apply to messaging on private sector platforms. Many people assumed Musk would be returning many Twitter-banned individuals and entities to the platform, including former President Donald Trump and The Babylon Bee news satire site, but Musk never said that was his goal.
Indeed, no one knows how Musk plans to run Twitter now that he has acquired the company. One of Musk’s most prominent critics, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, opined: “Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?”
Maybe Bezos is the wrong messenger in this particular case, considering his business ties to China and his rivalry with Musk, but the message deserves attention. China’s government and several Chinese corporations working with the government’s blessings have provided the cash to support Musk’s corporate success, and he has responded with near-slavish devotion to his Beijing benefactors.
Quite frankly, what role, if any, will China’s government play in a Musk-run Twitter?
A Reason For Concern? Musk wasn’t always the world’s richest man, and on multiple occasions he received Chinese financial assistance. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis, this included loans that Musk received from Chinese banks in 2019 and 2020 plus a $1.4 billion facility to help with the construction of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) factory in Shanghai.
In 2017, the Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd. (OTC: TCHEY) acquired a 5% stake in Tesla, which Musk welcomed by tweeting about how he was “glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla.” Tencent operates the WeChat social media app banned under the Trump administration over data privacy issues; President Joe Biden lifted that ban last June.
Last November, the Shanghai-based Leo Group attempted to make a $50 million investment in Musk’s privately held SpaceX through a partnership deal, but that fell through when the partnership was abruptly terminated after Leo Group’s input.

It is anyone’s guess how the deal will wind up, but Tesla and Twitter shareholders should be aware of what Tuesday’s price action may be indicating: Musk’s purchase of Twitter may not go through, and if it does, it may have a negative long-term impact on the price of Tesla shares.
Risk Arbs Not Biting: With a $54.20 cash deal on the table, the risk arbs want nothing to do with riding out the last roughly $4 of the deal. In fact, the issue peaked on Monday at $52.29, shortly after the deal was announced, and has been under selling pressure in Tuesday’s session, moving farther away from the takeout price as it struggles to remain above $50.

He's happy, he looks like he got it.
Homer Simpson receives a basket of food and, also, a nice welcome. After years of grumbling with Mr. Burns, Homer has changed jobs. His boss is the very nice Hank Scorpio (""The Simpsons,"" Season 8, Episode 2, 1996).
""I've never liked to see myself on top of other people. I'm just like you. Sure, I have better hours, I earn a lot more, I get more vacation time, but I'm not more than you,"" Scorpio tells Homer.
However, minutes later, Hank reveals himself as a psychopath who threatens the United Nations with a nuclear device, is determined to kill Mr. Bont - a hero who parodies James Bond, and faces an army carrying a flamethrower because of a ""little problem with the government.""
Oddly enough, Hank never stopped being nice to Homer. Thus, the question arises: Can people be relatable and, at the same time, a supervillain?
In the edges of the Internet, a conspiracy theory was soon woven: What if, in reality, Hank Scorpio is inspired by a real-life character?

Early Days: Markus got into cryptocurrency due to Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) but quickly pivoted to other easier-to-mine coins like Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) and Litecoin clones. He said it took a long time to mine a small amount of Bitcoin in a week (0.04) and made his room really hot.
Markus gave himself a weekend project to create his own coin, which became Bell’s. He was obsessed with Nintendo Co (OTC: NTDOY) game “Animal Crossing” at the time.
Markus stumbled upon a site called dogecoin.com where Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer made a joke coin but hadn’t created a physical coin yet. The site said if you want to make the coin to contact him.
Markus contacted Palmer and before even hearing back went to work on creating the meme coin we know today.
The project took only a couple of hours to make as Doge was a fork from Bell’s. The most time-consuming part was perfecting the Comic Sans font, Markus said.

2022-05-03T16:10:16Z,Why This Trader Is Ignoring Elon Musk's Investing Advice,"It seems once you have achieved a certain level of success in life and gained a global reputation and following, you can fall into the trap of allowing your ego to be larger than your knowledge base. You often see this with influencers positioning themselves as experts in fields and industries in which they are clearly out of their depth. 
If you have not bulletproofed yourself from this behaviour through the proper education, you leave yourself vulnerable. 
Below is a recent tweet from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. I will explain why listening to this advice will turn your stock portfolio into a constant source of stress and disappointment. 

Let's start with the opening line. 
'Since I've been asked a lot:'
Musk is a highly successful entrepreneur, not a stock market investor. The skills he has developed may be transferable from business to business, but they are not transferable to the stock market. Investing requires a whole different skill set that Musk does not have based on this tweet. 
The fact that he claims to be asked a lot about what stocks to invest in shows how disconnected his followers are and how financial illiteracy, a pandemic that gets little mainstream media attention, is a genuine issue.
Musk deserves admiration for what he has achieved but not at the expense of your own success. If you want inspiration on starting, growing and exiting a business, then Musk is the perfect source. Yet there are far better-qualified individuals to seek guidance on picking the right stocks for your ..."

The next appearance for Musk was in 2018 — the theme was ""Heavenly Bodies"" — when he didn't bring mom but introduced singer Grimes as his girlfriend. The duo attended the gala in 2021 when it was in September, but while Grimes walked the red carpet, Musk did not, joining her inside and then hosting an afterparty. They have since broken up and she is the mother of two of his eight children.

Risk management is crucial. It is the difference between growing and blowing an account and how quickly. 
There is the 90/90/90 saying; that 90% of traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days, possibly quicker. Broker stats released here in the U.K., where I am from, confirm that, and I think it would also be a pretty accurate global representation. 
But before we can even consider risk management, which is one of the final pieces of the investing puzzle, you must have the ability to pick high-probability stocks. 
Trading With An Edge: Impeccable risk management skills will never substitute for poor stocks, so unless you adopt an analysis process that identifies stocks displaying a proven edge, your portfolio will always struggle to gain traction. 
An edge is where you have more chance of making a profit than a loss. There is a saying that if you cannot define your edge, you don't have one. And if you don't have an edge, you will get eaten by someone who does. Remember, as we are playing on probabilities, never certainties, even an edge can fail, and this is where risk and exit management come into play.
It is repeatedly acting ..."

(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk to borrow money tax-free using his Tesla shares as collateral to fund his $44 billion proposed buyout of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR).
Noah argued there's a contradiction to the idea that unrealized gains in stock holdings are not eligible to be taxed but can be used as collateral, seemingly providing billionaires such as Musk access to unrealized stock gains tax-free.
""You can buy a thing based on what you have? Yes. But when we want to tax you, you can say 'I don't have it.'...Just think of the illogic of it. It's such a fun game that billionaires get to play because all their money is in [the stock market],"" Noah said.

This has been the looming question on the minds of Americans since inflation topped at 8.5% in March, matched with other indicators such as rising interest rates and the bond market’s inverted yield curve.
Top economists are split on the inevitability of a recession. Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said over the weekend, “It’s certainly a very, very high-risk factor,” but believes that the Fed is responding well to the risk.
Moody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) chief economist Mark Zandi predicted a 35% probability that America will enter a recession in the next two years. Twitter Inc.'s (NYSE: TWTR) most-loved Elon Musk predicted a recession as early as the summer of 2022.
Conflicting outlooks aside, it is essential to look at the facts and what has historically preceded a recession.
The yield curve inverted on March 29 for the first time since 2019. This occurs when the short-term U.S. treasury is paying a higher interest rate than long-term U.S. treasuries. More than that, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a 50 basis point increase, up from the traditional 0.25% at the last ..."
