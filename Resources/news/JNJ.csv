2022-04-08T20:57:14Z,This Is How To Make $1000/mo In Passive Income With These Top 9 Dividend Stocks To Hold Forever,"Do you want to make $1000 a month in passive income? I don't blame you; I mean, who wouldn't want to earn that. This article will cover investing in dividend stocks to get you to $1000 a month in passive income. What would you do with the money? Would you go on a vacation, say the Caribbean or on a cruise, or use it for a downpayment on a new home or a fancy new sports car? 
Whatever you can dream about, it's definitely possible - you just need a plan to get there. And that's why I put this article together. 
It's split into two parts. 
The first part is a portfolio of quality dividend stocks that investors like you and I can buy and get $1000 a month in passive income. And the second part is the plan to get there. 

What is a dividend stock?
A dividend stock is a stock that pays cash, usually quarterly - or three times a year. If you look up a company that says it has a 3% dividend yield, then it means they pay 3% a year, based on the current stock price. So, if you take a company whose stock price is $100, and they pay $3 a share every year, then it means they pay a 3% dividend - based on today's share price - per year.
How much do you need to make $1000 a month in dividends?
I'm going to break it to you quickly. To make $1000 a month in dividends or passive income, you will need about $250,000 invested. And that might sound like a LOT, but I'm going to show you how you can do it too. It's easy; just about anyone can do it. And, even if you don't have a lot of money to invest.   
You might be wondering, ""what do I know about dividends and making a passive income."" Well, I've been living off my stocks since 2014. I trade tech stocks, dividend stocks and also sell covered calls and cash secured puts. And doing so has allowed me to move to Italy, travel the world, and live the best life I possibly could.  
When it comes to dividend investing to generate passive income, you have to ask yourself, which dividend stocks do I choose? You want to pick stocks with a safe dividend because if it gets cut, then what? Right? 
9 Dividend Stocks To Generate $1000/mo In Passive Income
The following stocks are dividend stocks; moreover, they are dividend kings. I picked these for a few reasons, mainly because they are gigantic companies that have paid dividends for more than 50 years. In fact, many have paid dividends for more than 60 consecutive years. The companies all make billions of dollars, and there's little doubt that they will be around for many years to come. And when it comes to picking stocks, it's always best to choose quality stocks with the characteristics.
