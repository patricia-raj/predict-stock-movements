In comparison, Chevron has negated a bull flag but has retained its uptrend, and if Exxon is able to break bullish from the flag formation, Chevron may follow it higher.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

The Russian currency fell by more than 10% from Friday to 137 to a dollar on Monday, underscoring the impact of the sanctions imposed by Western nations on the Russian economy and on residents’ living standards.
In 2021, the country’s gross domestic product rose 4.7% year over year, boosted by the global economic recovery and the global surge in the prices of oil, one of Russia’s key commodities. GDP rebounded last year — after contracting 2.7% in 2020 — to the fastest since the 2008 global financial crisis.
 

Russia GDP
Worst recession in three decades
But with the developments surrounding Russia’s war with Ukraine, many economists are predicting a recession that could be worse than the 1990s in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse. Analysts at JP Morgan expect Russia’s GDP to shrink 11% this year, sharper than the 5.3% contraction in 1998 after the country’s debt crisis.

While crude oil is the main driver of global market uncertainty, a number of other commodities have also been extremely volatile since the Ukraine conflict began.
Unfortunately, commodities were already experiencing significant upward pricing pressure even before Russia entered Ukraine thanks to lingering pandemic supply chain issues, booming global demand and U.S. inflation levels at roughly 40-year highs. Here are five commodity ETFs that investors can buy if they believe inflation is here to stay.
United States Oil ETF (NYSE: USO)
The United States Oil ETF is by far the most popular way for investors to trade West Texas intermediate crude oil prices. The fund tracks front-month light sweet crude oil futures contracts, making it subject to severe contango.

The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ..."

Here’s a look at how quickly Musk could become a trillionaire and if he is on pace to be the first to hit this new status.
Who Could Be First Trillionaire?: John D. Rockefeller became the first billionaire in the world in 1916. Rockefeller was the founder of Standard Oil, an oil giant that was later split due to antitrust concerns.
Standard Oil is now represented by Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), BP plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), which all own pieces of Rockefeller's former company. 
It took another 83 years before someone passed the $100 billion wealth mark: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.

(Friday Market Open) Another day, another round of earnings reports. However, the dark cloud of rising interest rates appears to be hanging over investors as equity index futures point to a lower open. Even the “happiest place on earth” is facing another storm.
Potential Market Movers
Disney (DIS) has lost ground after revelations from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) that its streaming service had lost subscribers and expects to lose many more. Now, the Florida legislature has voted to end Disney’s 50-year-old special self-governing district by June 1, 2023. The self-governing district allowed Disney to collect taxes, provide emergency services, and build new structures without local government approval. However, according to CNBC, the move may result in Florida taxpayers absorbing a $1 billion bond debt. There’s also the question of whether Florida will now be entitled to the additional tax revenue that the special Disney district was collecting as well as building and permit fees. Obviously, there’s a lot more to come on this story and how it will  affect Disney going forward.
While Disney is dealing with its own issues, the rest of the market will likely be undergoing another revaluation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s more hawkish tone on Thursday caused stocks to fall and yields to rise. On the bright side, the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) was down about 16 basis points in premarket trading which may take some of the sting out of valuation calculations.
The dreary outlook is even affecting companies with otherwise positive earnings reports. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reported that it hit analysts’ earnings estimates on the nose and saw better-than-expected revenues, but still fell 1.6% in pre-market trading. VZ issued forward guidance at the lower end of its fiscal 2022 range. The lower guidance came as VZ cut its sales forecast and reported struggles with inflation. One problem Verizon is likely expecting is that budget-conscious consumers will likely be looking for cheaper carrier plans as inflation pushes tighter household purse strings.
American Express (NYSE: AXP) was also trading lower despite beating on top and bottom-line numbers. AXP was down about 1% before the market open when the company failed to raise its earnings outlook and only reaffirmed previous guidance.  
Despite higher gold prices, Newmont (NYSE: NEM) missed on earnings and revenue estimates due to higher extraction and production costs. The company added an additional 5% for costs in its 2022 outlook. Management effectiveness is key in a time of rising input costs, which means NEM managers need to find a way to cut costs elsewhere if possible. Newmont was down 4.1% in premarket trading, adding to its Thursday loss of 6.7%.
One company that appears to be managing costs while benefiting from higher commodity prices is Schlumberger (NYSE: SL). Not only did the company beat ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"
