Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is surely looking to climb out of the hole her flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF (ARCA:ARKK), tumbled in 2021, but the Innovation ETF just keeps digging deeper. 
ARK's Innovation fund hit a new 52-week low on Friday when it fell below the $65 level. It's now down about 60% from its all-time high and it's already approaching a 30% decline in the first month of the year.
Despite its dramatic underperformance over the last year or so, the ARK Innovation ETF is still up about 60% over a three-year period and more than 210% over a five-year period.
The longer-term gains can be largely attributed to the outperformance of some of Wood's biggest positions. Here is a look at the top 5 holdings in the ARK Innovation ETF:
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 


Weighting: 8.07%


52-Week Range: $539.49 - $1,243.49


Current Price: $818.63


Wood may be most well-known for her early and consistent admiration of Tesla. A few months ago, the ARK Invest founder and CEO said her expectations for the stock continue to increase with Tesla's market share. Her base case is $3,000 per share, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed with, contingent upon the company's ability to ""execute really well."" Still, Wood has been trimming her Tesla position and moving money into more beaten-down stocks in recent weeks.

An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.
The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control, while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages), indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend.
A stock often signals when the higher high is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bearish engulfing or hanging man candlestick. Likewise, the higher low could be signaled when a doji, morning star or hammer candlestick is printed. Moreover, the higher highs and higher lows often take place at resistance and support levels.
In an uptrend, the ""trend is your friend"" until it’s not, and in an uptrend there are ways for both bullish and bearish traders to participate in the stock:

Bullish traders who are already holding a position in a stock can feel confident the uptrend will continue unless the stock makes a lower low. Traders looking to take ..."
