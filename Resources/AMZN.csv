The investment themes may carry over into 2022, which could make some thematic ETFs worth considering in January and further into the year.
Here is a look at five ETFs for investors to consider in 2022.
Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE: BETZ)

Launched: June 2020
Assets Under management: $287 million
Price: $24.82
52-Week Range: $22.55 to $33.26
Year-to-date: -4%

The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF offers pure-play exposure to a high growth, well publicized storyline for investors and sports fans. More states are legalizing sports betting and more sports and teams are partnering with betting companies. After a strong 2020, this ETF ended 2021 down on the year.
The company counts many international names in the top 10 holdings including Kindred Group, Kambi Group, Flutter Entertainment (OTC: PDYPY) and Entain. Rush Street Interactive (NYSE: RSI), Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ: PENN) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) also rank in the top 10 holdings.
While there is some risk of sports pausing their seasons or delaying their games, sometimes a schedule change can work out as a positive with more dates for bettors to wager on.
The ETF and its holdings should get plenty of headlines in early January, with the NCAA Football Championship Game coming on Jan. 10, 2022. The ETF could also benefit from the NFL’s Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Last year’s Super Bowl set a sports betting handle record and saw heavy customer acquisition promotions by company’s to boost user totals.

2022-01-05T14:55:27Z,What Does the Selling of Bonds Tell Us About Investor Sentiment?,"While equity index futures are still pointing to a lower open on Wednesday, they did trim some losses after the ADP Nonfarm Employment report showed strong gains in December. More than twice as many workers as expected found jobs last month, particularly in leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation, and utilities. Much of these gains may have occurred before the Omicron variant really hit the scene so we’ll have to wait and see if they stick.
Later today, the FOMC Meeting Minutes will be released and investors will have insight into what the Fed has been discussing, particularly related to tapering and future interest rate hikes.
The Nasdaq-100 Futures (/NQ) are leading the slide on Wednesday once again. The Cboe Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN)—also known as the Vixen—is the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) equivalent of the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index), which is related to the S&P 500 (SPX). The Vixen rose 5.43% on Tuesday as investors sold tech stocks. While this may signal trouble for some tech companies, the fact that the VIX was relatively unchanged could be a good sign for the majority of stocks in the near term.  
One company that struggled to grow on Tuesday was Scott’s Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG). Scott’s fell 2.79% after providing guidance saying it would maintain its full-year earnings outlook, but its Hawthorne cannabis division expects a 40% decline in sales. The company cited the slowdown in the cannabis market and issues with the supply chain.
The ISM Manufacturing PMI was lower than expected, suggesting that manufacturers are seeing fewer orders. December was the 19th straight month of increases, but the slowdown may actually be a welcomed reprieve because it may provide relief to an already strained supply chain.
The JOLTS report also showed a decrease in job openings in November. The Great Resignation continues as the “quits” rate remained high. In the light of Wednesday’s ADP report, it may be that workers were simply quitting one job to take another job. Friday’s Employment Situation report could provide greater insights to these job market developments.
Many stocks turned bearish after the manufacturing and job opening announcements; the S&P 500 (SPX) was positioned for a new all-time high, but it turned negative ..."

2022-01-05T20:10:38Z,Why This Analyst Is Bullish On Plug Power,"Plug Power, Inc., a 3Hydrogen fuel-cell energy company, has been making strides with its execution on all fronts.

While names like Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE: GM) are known to be heavily investing in EVs, three names announcing plans this week to begin the development of electric vehicles might be surprising to readers.
Sony: At the past two Consumers Electronics Shows, Sony Corp (NYSE: SONY) has hinted at getting into the electric vehicle space, even showing off a prototype last year.
During CES 2022 on Tuesday, Sony unveiled a prototype electric SUV called the Vision-S 02. The vehicle is the second prototype from the company, following the Vision-S 01 electric car that was unveiled in 2020.
To show how serious the company might be about electric vehicles, Sony announced it had created a new business segment called Sony Mobility that will handle the vehicles under development.
“We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.
A new electric vehicle from Sony could come as technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is planning to launch an electric car by 2025 under the current name of Project Titan.
Unlike Apple that has been relatively quiet on the details of its planned electric vehicles, Sony has now shown off two prototypes and last year shared that it was working with partners that included NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:"

Alibaba Regains Momentum At Start Of Year:  Alibaba got off to a strong start in 2022, gaining over 1% Monday before ending at $120.38.
This marked a turnaround for the stock, which ended 2021 at $118.79, down 49% for the year. Alibaba's problems stem from  regulatory woes,  as the Chinese government hounded big tech stocks to rein them in, and a softening fundamental outlook.

The Rivian Thesis:  Rivian investors should keep near-term expectations managed, as ramping EV manufacturing follows an extremely difficult path, analyst Jonas said in a note.
Rivian's recent stock weakness has to do with the broader tech sell-off, pushed out R1 delivery schedules of some variants, and the partnership announced between Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA), the analyst said.

A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart.
The lower lows indicate the bears are in control while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend and descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term downtrend.
A stock often signals when the lower low is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bullish engulfing or hammer candlestick. Likewise, the lower high could be signaled when a doji, gravestone or dragonfly candlestick is printed. Moreover, the lower lows and lower highs often take place at resistance and support levels.

2022-01-10T16:30:06Z,Analysis: Does The Untelevised Golden Globes Have Any Impact On Movies And Television?,"The 79th Annual Golden Globe Awards were presented Sunday night in a ceremony that could be described as the ultimate antithesis of a Hollywood awards show: No celebrities were in attendance to hand out or receive the trophies and the event was without media attendance.
Backstory: The bare-bones event was the result of the entertainment industry’s response to several scandals that engulfed the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the sponsor of the awards, including reports on the absence of Black membership within the association and influence-peddling by would-be nominees.
NBC, the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) unit that has the broadcast rights to the awards show, opted not to put the event on the air this year while all of the on-screen and behind-the-camera talent nominated for the awards chose not to attend.
Still, the HFPA took a show-must-goes-on attitude by hosting a private function for its membership and announcing the winners via press release.
The Big Screen Winners: The Golden Globes divides its awards between film and television, with the cinematic honors often providing a bellwether on what to expect from the Academy Awards later in the season.
Netflix’s (NASDAQ: NFLX) “The Power of the Dog” won the Best Picture (Drama) prize, with Jane Campion winning Best Director and Kodi Smit-McPhee named Best Supporting Actor. “West Side Story” from the Walt Disney Co.’s (NYSE: DIS) 20th Century ..."

What Was Claimed: In an interview with the British media out The Guardian, Ali Vahdait, founder and CEO of Digital i, observed that Netflix has lost the streaming rights to five series that are owned by Disney — “How I Met Your Mother,” “Modern Family,” “New Girl,” “Prison Break” and “Sons of Anarchy” — and will soon be losing the rights to “Homeland.”
“The viewing to these six titles, five of which have already left Netflix, was significant in the U.K.,” said Vahdati. “This means a significant number of subscribers will begin to question their Netflix subscription and look to the new home of their favorite content, Disney+.”

The stocks are headed toward their quarterly earnings print, with Amazon expecting to report on Feb. 3 after the closing bell and Alibaba before the markets open on Feb. 8. Both multinational tech and e-commerce giants have suffered massive declines, although Alibaba has been hit harder for a longer period of time, currently trading down 62% off its Oct. 27, 2020 all-time high of $319.32, while Amazon is down a total of 26% since reaching a July 13, 2021 all-time high of $3,773.08.
Despite its larger decline, looking ahead to 2022 Alibaba may have more room to regain ground because although both stocks look bearish in the short-term, Alibaba has shown signs its bottom may be in.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is surely looking to climb out of the hole her flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF (ARCA:ARKK), tumbled in 2021, but the Innovation ETF just keeps digging deeper. 
ARK's Innovation fund hit a new 52-week low on Friday when it fell below the $65 level. It's now down about 60% from its all-time high and it's already approaching a 30% decline in the first month of the year.
Despite its dramatic underperformance over the last year or so, the ARK Innovation ETF is still up about 60% over a three-year period and more than 210% over a five-year period.
The longer-term gains can be largely attributed to the outperformance of some of Wood's biggest positions. Here is a look at the top 5 holdings in the ARK Innovation ETF:
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 


Weighting: 8.07%


52-Week Range: $539.49 - $1,243.49


Current Price: $818.63


Wood may be most well-known for her early and consistent admiration of Tesla. A few months ago, the ARK Invest founder and CEO said her expectations for the stock continue to increase with Tesla's market share. Her base case is $3,000 per share, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed with, contingent upon the company's ability to ""execute really well."" Still, Wood has been trimming her Tesla position and moving money into more beaten-down stocks in recent weeks.

What Happened: Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a recent note that tech stocks “way oversold on Fed fears.”
The analyst noted a wide array of negative issues like the expected interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical tensions. He said these have created a “perfect storm sell off” in tech stocks over the last month.
Ives said that while “multiples will compress,” the “underlying growth for the tech space is being underestimated by the Street (as seen so far during a strong tech earnings season) and will thus neutralize some of these perceived Fed tightening Headwinds.”

In an otherwise slow week for the entertainment industry, the Spotify story helped to fill a void for show business news. But in the never-slow world of partisan posturing, it seemed to reinforce entrenched opinions on both sides of the COVID debate.
However, what should one make of this brouhaha from a financial perspective? From that angle, the view is somewhat peculiar.

Publicity Harvests: The whole kerfuffle began on Jan. 25 when singer/songwriter Neil Young made an unexpected demand of Spotify: remove “The Joe Rogan Experience” from its platform or he would demand the removal of his music. Young accused the Rogan podcast of spreading misinformation on COVID-19 and stated, “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.”
When Spotify refused to jettison Rogan, Young had his music taken from the site. Another 1970s singer/songwriter, Joni Mitchell, followed suit.
But a few things were overlooked with these actions.
First, Young had a history of complaining about Spotify. In 2019, he threatened to have his music removed from the platform because he felt its sound quality was unsatisfactory. He never went through with that threat.
Second, Young’s latest album “Barn” was released last month, which was followed by an accompanying documentary directed by his wife, actress Daryl Hannah. Despite generating appreciative reviews, Young’s work ultimately got lost in the holiday season shuffle, peaking at #6 on Billboard’s Top Rock Albums chart and #66 on the Billboard Top 200 chart before slipping downward. With the new wave of publicity tied to Rogan, Young brought a fresh focus on his recent work that would ..."

Venture online, and you will often see the usual suspects that budding investors and traders follow. This list includes:

Gamestop Corp. (NYSE: GME) 
Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) 
The EUR-USD
Gold

Tons of penny stocks 
And Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 

A portfolio that performs consistently requires rebalancing periodically. This involves understanding when to let go of assets that are not performing, either in profit or loss, and adding new assets that are now displaying an edge. 
An edge is when an asset has set up to offer more chance of returning a profit or a loss. For us as busy everyday people, the simplest and quickest way to define an edge is using technical analysis on the higher timeframes. This allows us to do less work but make more profit by holding and compounding, a process that also fits well around our busy lifestyles without any compromise on time and profit.

Here is a look at the stocks that were searched for the most on Benzinga Pro for the month of January.
1. SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY)

YTD Return: -4.6%
52-Week Range: $379.37 to $479.98
Price: $453.92

The S&P 500 themed ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro for the month of January. The ETF was the eighth most searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro. The ETF and S&P 500 Index serves as gauges for overall market strength and news, which could lead to an increase in searches for the ticker to find macros news and themes.
2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)

YTD Return: -11.9%
52-Week Range: $539.49 to $1243.49
Price: $889.49

The most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in all of 2021 comes in second place to start 2022. The electric vehicle giant had nearly as many searches as SPY in January, but came up just short. Tesla reported quarterly earnings in January, which likely helped with continued interest in the stock.

@bobby_soco is looking to potentially take a short position in Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON).
Peloton has been on a downward trajectory since Jan. 14, 2021, when the stock hit an all-time high of $171.09. The steep dive has been escalated by a number of news items including on March 19, when the company disclosed the death of a child in an accident involving its Tread+ bike, and rumors of a production halt, which the company's CEO John Foley said were false.
The exercise equipment manufacturer also reported a revenue miss for the first quarter of 2022 on Nov. 4, which resulted in a 33% gap down the following trading day. Since that date the stock has fallen another 56.59%, which amounts to a whopping approximately 85% decline in Peloton’s value since it reached its all-time high.

2022-02-07T18:58:33Z,7 Of The Best Nasdaq Stocks to Buy On The Dip,"The S&P 500 is off to a shaky start to 2022, down 5.5% year-to-date. As bad as things have been for the S&P 500, they have been even worse for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is down 9.9% so far in this year.
Investors are dumping Nasdaq stocks due to concerns over rising interest rates, which negatively impact the valuation of growth stocks and unprofitable companies. But the rotation out of Nasdaq stocks has also created some buying opportunities for long-term investors willing to stomach the volatility.
Here are seven of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy, according to Bank of America.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Shares of iPhone maker Apple have held up relatively well so far in 2022, down just 2.4% year-to-date. Analyst Wamsi Mohan says Apple's robust cash flow provides defense for investors against a volatile market backdrop. Mohan is projecting a strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal 2023 driven by 5G upgrades that will enable more virtual reality and augmented reality applications. In addition, he says an increasing mix of high-margin Services segment growth will boost Apple's profitability and reduce its reliance on iPhone sales numbers.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $215 price target for AAPL stock.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Microsoft shares haven't fared as well as Apple so far in 2022, falling 9% year-to-date. Microsoft made major headlines in January when it announced a $68.7 billion buyout of video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI), Microsoft's largest acquisition in company history. The tech giant is clearly going all-in on gaming, but analyst Brad Sills says there are plenty of other reasons to like the stock, including its potential for accelerating ..."

2022-02-07T21:09:57Z,"5 Consumer Staples With Earnings To Watch This Week: Coke, Pepsi, Yum Brands And More","The week of Feb. 7 is full of quarterly earnings reports from some of the largest publicly traded companies.
Benzinga Pro covers the latest headlines on every stock and also highlights expected earnings for companies while taking a look at whether companies beat or miss analyst expectations.
This week’s earnings reports includes several companies tied to consumers for at home consumption. Three of the companies are valued at more than $250 billion each, while the other two names find themselves on the list for other reasons.
Walt Disney: Media and consumer products giant Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is set to report first quarter earnings on Wednesday after market close. Analysts are expecting the company to post revenue of $18.7 billion. The company has beat revenue estimates from the street in the last two quarters, according to Benzinga Pro.
The $18.7 billion figure would be significantly ahead of the fourth quarter’s total of $16.3 billion. Prior to the pandemic, Disney was reporting revenue of over $20 billion in the first quarter of fiscal years, so the figure reported could go a long way in showing how well the company is progressing in its recovery.
Most eyes will be drawn to the subscriber figure reported for the Disney+ streaming platform. Figures for the Parks, Experience & Products segment could be more important to the overall health of the company.
Overall revenue was up 26% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The Parks segment saw revenue increase 99% year-over-year thanks to the parks being reopened. Reports indicated ..."

Munster noted the internal rifts within the company that led to leaks that gave the broader media an opportunity to “feast on.”

And The Winners Are: The big winner in this year’s Oscar race is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), whose drama “The Power of the Dog” dominated the competition with 12 nominations including Best Picture. Netflix’s releases “Don’t Look Up,” The Lost Daughter: and “Tick, Tick…BOOM!” also scored nominations in the major prestige categories.
Netflix's Oscar nominees continue the company's tradition of serving up diverse and often eccentric programming designed to stand out from the competition. Its series including “Stranger Things,” “The Crown,” “Squid Game,” “Bridgerton” and “Emily in Paris” dominate popular culture and the added prestige of multiple Oscar nominations for its film line-up will work to Netflix’s advantage. At the pace it's going, it's not difficult to see Netflix’s subscription levels increase over the course of the year — which, of course, is what investors are hoping to see.
The Oscar nominations have also affirmed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as a Hollywood power player. Its release “CODA” is the company’s first Best Picture nominee; the film received a total of three nominations, and Apple’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth” also scored three nominations including a Best Actor nod for Denzel Washington.

An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.
The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control, while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages), indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend.
A stock often signals when the higher high is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bearish engulfing or hanging man candlestick. Likewise, the higher low could be signaled when a doji, morning star or hammer candlestick is printed. Moreover, the higher highs and higher lows often take place at resistance and support levels.
In an uptrend, the ""trend is your friend"" until it’s not, and in an uptrend there are ways for both bullish and bearish traders to participate in the stock:

Bullish traders who are already holding a position in a stock can feel confident the uptrend will continue unless the stock makes a lower low. Traders looking to take ..."

2022-02-11T18:00:31Z,Will The US Legalize Cannabis In 2022? Experts & Lobbyists Explain What Investors Can Expect,"What can we expect from legalization in 2022? Benzinga Cannabis Insider brought together three renowned cannabis advocates to talk about the prospects of federal legalization in 2022, state-by-state legislation and what to expect from federal policy reform and what financial trends this long-awaited process might unleash.  
Sarah Chase, executive director of the Council for Federal Cannabis Regulation (CFCR), Tom Zuber from Zuber Lawler, one of the top law firms working in the cannabis industry and Brady Cobb, lawyer and CEO of Bluma Wellness/One Plant (CNSX: CL), joined Javier Hasse and Elliot Lane. They began with the various cannabis bills in Congress and their impact in the cannabis industry. 
Step-By-Step: Trade-offs Of An Incremental Pathway 
Zuber called the regulatory landscape confusing and said he would be satisfied with the SAFE Act passing this year. “There are such a plethora of acronyms out there and it's hard to keep track, a new one seems to arrive every quarter, but there are a few key ones that we've been focused on I think the SAFE Act has been with us since I don't know, Clinton was president.” He highlighted that there seems to be a momentum to tackle banking reform. The SAFE Act would allow cannabis companies access to federal banking services.
He added that the States Reform Act “would legalize cannabis at the federal level or at least decriminalize it and that would have implications for banking and the interstate commerce of cannabis. He said the big question is whether to “wait for that big enchilada” or try and take the milestone victory and go for the SAFE Act.
Likewise, Cobb said he would be satisfied with the SAFE Act, noting that winning begets winning. ""In today's world of instant gratification and social media (...) things do not happen instantly. Everyone is very Veruca Salt in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that's not how DC works. DC is about incrementalism, inch-by-inch.” 
Empowering social equity and access to capital is vital, Cobb said. From a political standpoint, he sent kudos to Rep. Nancy Mace (R) for filing the State's Reform Act and receiving the support of “some real companies in American industry” including “the Koch brothers” and Amazon. He emphasized the importance of achieving bipartisan support. 
“When I first started lobbying in the senate we focused primarily on Senate republicans because that's who we needed to flip, it was a very cold reception in those offices back in 2015 and it wasn't until you saw some of the east coast states like Florida (...)l that we've got a little bit of a warmer reception (...) I think we really need to focus as an industry on what safe's going to do from a crime prevention standpoint from a social equity funding,” Cobb added and referred to the SAFE Act as uniformly known in congress as the bill that has the ..."

Affirm's earnings were released earlier than planned on Twitter at around 1:30 p.m. ET. Affirm later said the tweet was an inadvertent posting due to human error.

Sean Udall, the tech stock strategist and the publisher of The Udall Report, posed this question Friday on PreMarket Prep: “What in the report was bad?”
Affirm's Q2 Report: Udall was unfazed by the EPS miss of 57 cents against an estimate of a 34-cent-per-share loss and said he was encouraged by the sales beat, $361 million vs. a $328.8-million estimate. 
He did not mind the conservative guidance and said it will temper expectations for the third quarter. 
The company sees third-quarter sales of $325 million-$335 million vs. a $330.07-million estimate and FY22 sales of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion vs. a $1.28-billion estimate.

What Happened: Costco reported second-quarter net sales of $50.9 billion, up 16.1% year-over-year. Total revenue of $51.9 billion for the quarter included $967 million from membership fees and beat a Street consensus estimate of $51.4 billion.
Along with the revenue, earnings per share and same store sales figures, Costco investors got another piece of news Thursday night.
On the company’s earnings call, CFO Richard Galanti discussed the potential for raising membership fees.
“I looked at the last three increases over the last 15 years and on average, they were done about every five, a little over every 5.5 years,” Galanti said. “And five years from the anniversary of the June of 2017 would be this June.”

(NYSE: DIS) will be releasing the latest Pixar animated feature “Turning Red” on its Disney+ streaming service. This marks the third consecutive Pixar production that was steered away from theatrical release and straight to a streaming premiere.
However, the company has arranged for a one-week theatrical release for “Turning Red” at Hollywood’s El Capitan Theatre, beginning March 11. Why is Disney dropping “Turning Red” into a single theater rather than providing it with a nationwide release?
The Reasoning: In order for a feature film to be eligible for the Academy Awards, it needs to have been given at least a one-week theatrical engagement in a Los Angeles-area cinema. It doesn’t matter if the film doesn't play in any other market, as long as that minimum requirement is met.
Other film award-giving entities including the Golden Globes, the film industry’s professional guilds and many ..."

Here’s a look at how Cohen’s biggest e-commerce bets have fared.
What Happened: It was announced over the weekend that Cohen holds a 9.8% stake in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond. Cohen and his investment firm RC Ventures are a top five shareholder in the company.
A letter sent to the Bed Bath & Beyond Board of Directors was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and is said to call for a push to streamline the company’s strategy and consider strategic alternatives like spinning off or selling the company’s Buybuy Baby brand.
The letter from Cohen comes as Bed Bath & Beyond laid out a turnaround plan that included reducing the number of items in stores and the launch of private label brands.
Cohen said that the spinoff of Buybuy Baby could be worth several billon dollars.
In the letter, Cohen said he is not in a position to join the board of Bed Bath & Beyond given his focus on GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME). Cohen could nominate candidates for the board, with a nomination window open now and closing in mid-March.
The retailer issued a statement Monday morning about Cohen’s letter.

What Happened: Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is exploring making a bid for the NFL rights in a multibillion-dollar deal, according to a report from Front Office Sports.
The National Football League is fielding offers for an equity stake in NFL Media, livestreaming games on mobile devices and the lucrative “NFL Sunday Ticket” package. Apple is said to be prepared to bid for all three items in one deal.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is considered the frontrunner by many to land the 49% stake in NFL Media, which includes the NFL Network, NFL RedZone and NFL.com.
The National Football League is also considering selling the three items as pieces to maximize the potential revenue, which could bring in around $2.5 billion for the league.

(Tuesday Market Open) Stocks look to bounce back from Monday’s selloff, hoping that Monday was a “wash out” day—a day where investors are able to unload their riskier assets to focus on blue chip and value. However, the Cboe Market Volatility Index (VIX) is higher on Tuesday morning, suggesting investor fear is still high. Oil prices are higher once again, trading more than 2% higher on a volatile overnight session.
On the bright side, investors appear to be getting help overseas as European markets were trading higher. The STOXX Europe 600 was 0.81% higher. The German DAX was rallying 1.51%. And the French CAC 40 was up 1.91%.
The Asian-Pacific markets are looking a little less bright. The Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.71%; the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped 1.39%, and the Shanghai Index tumbled 2.35%.  
The Good, Bad, & Ugly
Some of the market’s old reliable stocks fell hard on Monday. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is testing its January lows after falling 5.62% on Monday. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) also fell 4.28% near its support level around 2,500. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also near support after falling 2.37%. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is in the same boat near support after selling off 3.78%. These companies could be the hope that the bulls need. If they’re able to hold support, stocks could get the bounce they need because of the combined market cap of these companies in the S&P 500.
While big-tech could act as an anchor for the S&P 500, banking appears to be a hole in the boat. The PHLX KBW Bank Index fell 4.62% on Monday. Additionally, financials are the second largest sector in the Russell 2000 (RUT), which helped the small-cap index fall 2.48% on Monday.
Banks were hit hard by credit card companies ending services in Russia. Visa (NYSE: V) fell 4.79%, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) dropped 5.39%, and American Express (NYSE: AXP) tumbled 7.99%. Falling yields are also pulling the banking sector lower because they’re shrinking the spread between lending and saving. For a couple months, all anyone could talk about was the Fed and next week’s rate decision, but now that story has faded into the background.
Oil Issues
The S&P 500 (SPX) broke the 4,300 support level that had been in place since July of 2021 and tested a few times after WTI crude oil futures spiked over the weekend—trading as high as $130 per barrel—as an increasing number of companies are choosing not to buy Russian oil. However, oil prices retreated to $120.10, which was still 3.8% higher than the closing price on Friday.
Rising oil prices helped the energy sector to be one of two sectors in the green on Monday. Investors appeared to favor the defensive nature of utilities overall because the Utilities Select Sector Index rose 1.31%. Treasuries also benefited from investors searching for safe havens because the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) fell 1.57%. Bond prices were even most of the day, but they found a lot of interest as the day wore on and investors started looking for safety. A third safe haven appeared to be ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

An analyst at BofA Securities, however, doesn't share the enthusiasm of investors, and here's why.
The Bed Bath & Beyond Analyst:  Jason Haas maintained an Underperform rating and the $9.50 price target for Bed Bath & Beyond.
The Bed Bath & Beyond Thesis:  Cohen, while buying into Bed Bath & Beyond, has called for changes in the retailer's turnaround strategy and exploration of strategic options. The strategic options suggested include separating Buy Buy Baby and a full sale of the company.

Here are all the sell-side reactions to the announcements:
The Apple Analysts:  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty maintained an Overweight rating and $210 price target on Apple shares.
Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Buy rating and $170 price target.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel has an Overweight rating and $191 price target.

Citigroup analyst Jim Suva has a Buy rating and $200 price target.
While, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster says AAPL will be a ""$250 stock in the next couple of years.""
Apple Remains Morgan Stanley's Top IT Hardware Pick:  Apple's product announcements are a testament to the unmatched output of its $26 billion, plus, R&D engine, Huberty said.
The company has successfully brought 5G capabilities to a sub-$500 iPhone price point, ported the M1 SoC to an additional iPad model and announced an in-house SoC, named M1 Ultra for the new Mac Studio, the analyst noted.
The iPhone SE3 likely presents upside risk to the iPhone estimates for 2022, the analyst said.

2022-03-20T12:27:00Z,"The State Of Streaming In 2022: The Search For New Content, New Revenue On Netflix, Disney+ And More","Among the various entertainment platforms, streaming services have become the dominant force is shaping popular culture. Over the past 12 months, this sector has brought forth programming that has invigorated home audiences (think of “Squid Game,” “Bridgerton” and “The Beatles: Get Back,” among countless others) and dominated the news headlines with controversies (Tucker Carlson's three-part Fox Nation series on the Jan. 6 siege, the brouhaha over Dave Chappelle’s “The Closer” special or the Scarlett Johansson lawsuit from last summer over the simultaneous theatrical and streaming releases of “Black Widow” by the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS).)
The streaming services, which were promoted during the height of the pandemic as an alternative entertainment source when movie theaters were closed, are now the dominant force in the most prestigious center of the film world – in this year’s Academy Award nominations, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) emerged as the powerhouse studios, gaining multiple nominations for such films as “The Power of the Dog,” “CODA,” “Don’t Look Up” and “Being the Ricardos.”
In a sense, the streaming sector has grown up. But while the sector is flexing its muscles to display its newfound strength, it is also discovering new muscles that have yet to be developed – which, in the near-future, could further solidify its audience base while generating new revenue streams.
Wider Horizons: Tim Nollen, senior media analyst at Macquarie Bank, predicted this transition would occur last December in his paper “Advertising and Media: Macro and Micro Themes for 2022,” with a forecast that the major media operations would prioritize streaming over other media platforms.
“A key common theme among the media networks is the launch and ramp up of their DTC streaming services, as these companies look to make the transition from pay TV to OTT business models,” Nollen wrote. “2021 was a particularly exciting time for this, especially with the launch of Discovery+ and the rebrand of Paramount+. But as 2021 new services come to market and existing services start to expand internationally, we believe that 2022 will be a year with heightened levels of competition as the streaming wars move to new levels.”
For the media companies, Nollen observed, there are no limits – either financial or geographic – in the pursuit of success.
“All of the media networks are talking about 2022 being an important investment year where elevated levels of content production are designed to attract and keep consumers to their service amid this increasingly more competitive environment,” he continued. “2022 will also be the year of international expansion as the newer services start to ramp up their international expansion and existing players engage in aggressive marketing to maintain and expand their market share.”
Seth Shafer, senior analyst at Kagan, the media research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, observed that the major streaming services are working aggressively to forge ahead of their rivals.
“We're still in a growing market – it's obviously a crowded market,” he said. “I think in 2022 we’re going to see more – and I hate to use warfare analogies, especially these days – intense competition between the major U.S. services to keep subscribers engaged and to minimize churn.”
See Also: Did Disney Cancel The In-Production Film Of 'Nimona' Because Of A Same-Sex Kiss?
Costs And Benefits: Shafer pointed out that today’s average consumer may subscribe to three-to-five streaming services, keeping “a couple as anchors and then moving in and out of their services as they catch up on content.” However, he cautioned that the recent dramatic changes in the economy might force many viewers ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ..."

They want education, information and easy back-and-forth communication with their financial services providers and embedded networks, as well as access.
That’s according to Nikki Varanasi the CEO and founder at Staax, a Techstars- and Western Union Co (NYSE: WU)-backed fintech building the first social, investment-based peer-to-peer payments platform.
Consumers want more than a “Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) meets Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ: HOOD),” she explained in her conversation with Benzinga on building transparent financial ecosystems targeted at younger demographics.
“They also don’t want to go on any Fidelity, E-Trade, or Robinhood and make their own decisions. They don’t know where to start.”
Inception: Varanasi, alongside Staax’s other founders — COO Lucy Yang and Victoria Yang — are building a Venmo for stocks, essentially.
The team has experience in finance, technology and policy at KKR & Co Inc (NYSE: KKR) and the White House, overseeing funds at McKinsey & Company and building infrastructure at Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN).
What kicked Staax off was that they saw a serious problem with existing stock gift services.

In DataTrek Research's daily newsletter this week, Nicholas Colas said stock splits shouldn't create any value for a company like Tesla. However, he said the case for proceeding with a split anyway comes down to ""memes, dreams and themes.""
The Case For A Split: First, Tesla's primary means of marketing is CEO Elon Musk's social media activity, and Colas said a lower stock price makes Tesla a more attractive investment for the small, retail investors that follow Musk's every tweet and post.

2022-04-01T19:46:10Z,Analysis: Formula One Adds Las Vegas—Here's Why US Growth Is So Important As Stock Hits 52-Week Highs,"Racing league Formula One confirmed a third U.S. race to happen in 2023. Here are the details about the announcement and why continued growth for the league in the U.S. is so important for the company and potentially, the stock.
What Happened: Formula One, a publicly-traded racing league owned by Liberty Formula One (NASDAQ: FWONA)(NASDAQ: FWONK), announced a long-rumored Las Vegas race being added to the circuit.
The Las Vegas Grand Prix will be added to the Formula One World Championship schedule in 2023, marking a total of three U.S. races with Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida, already on the schedule. In 2022, the Miami Grand Prix is set for May and the U.S. Grand Prix in Texas is set for October.
The race will be unique for several reasons, including taking place Saturday night versus the traditional Sunday time slot and on the Las Vegas Strip with racers competing against the backdrop of famous hotels, casinos and neon lights.
The Las Vegas Grand Prix will be held in November 2023. The race will be promoted by Formula One and Liberty Media along with partner Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV). Other partners in the race include MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN), Resorts World, The Venetian Resort and MSG Sphere, a music and sports entertainment arena from Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp (NYSE: MSGE).
“There is no better place for Formula One to race than in the global entertainment capital of the world and we cannot wait to be here next year,” Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said.
Why It’s Important For Las Vegas: After the announcement, some were quick to point out that a portion of Las Vegas streets will be shut down on a Saturday night.
While this sounds like a negative for the city, it’s important to remember the huge audience Formula One draws and the potential in money spent on hotel rooms and at casinos, benefitting the city and major ..."

2022-04-10T12:39:04Z,5 Luxurious Cruises You Can Still Book For 2022 (Plus Some Movies For Inspiration),"Is it time to book a cruise to the Galapagos Islands? Sail along the Nile River?
If you ask the Magic 8-Ball, the answer would be ""Without a Doubt."" Who are we to contradict?
What Happened: The travel industry was one of the hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many thought there would be a stronger return for the cruise sector in 2021, the second and third lockdowns that year stalled recovery.
""While the cruise industry has experienced a 96% Year-on-Year (YoY) increase of passengers, reaching 13.9 million, it still does not compare to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, where there were 29.7 million passengers globally,"" stated a report from Ship Technology. 
The year 2022 looks to be better and includes a number of new cruise ships making their debuts and some luxury cruises with special perks. 
Stephanie Miller Murphy of Miller Murphy Travel said there are some good deals for luxury cruises. 

""If clients are looking to book within 2022, there is quite a bit of value to be found,"" Miller Murphy said. ""Luxury cruise lines are offering incentives to get clients back onboard, including complimentary upgrades and onboard credits.""
She said ships are currently operating at limited capacity, yet fully staffed. ""This gives guests an over-the-top, white-glove service experience. A real value for the short-term,"" Miller Murphy added.
Looking into the future, the demand for 2023 is high, she said. ""The best itineraries are already filling up. Now is the time to book if you want specific dates, itineraries, suites and location on ships.""
Miller Murphy recommends working with a travel advisor that has your best interest in mind. ""Travel advisors can track sailings and get notified if pricing goes down,"" she said. ""Cruise lines are happy to match any lower published pricing after a cruise has been booked.""
Miller Murphy pointed out that each cruise line has its own COVID-19 safety protocols, and it is important to know the requirements in advance of booking a cruise.

Here’s a look at the major news stories about the team and how the latest could spell an exit for Commanders’ owner Dan Snyder.
What Happened: A new report filed with the Federal Trade Commission alleges the Washington Commanders of the National Football League “purposefully withheld ticket revenue that’s meant to be shared with the rest of the league.” The report also says the team failed to refund up to $5 million in security deposits to fans.
“We are writing to share evidence of concerning business practices by the Washington Commanders uncovered during the Committee’s ongoing investigation into workplace misconduct as a team,” members of the House Oversight Committee said in a letter to the FTC.
NFL teams must give 40% of their home ticket sales to the league. This total then gets distributed to the other 31 teams in the league.
Commanders’ former VP of sales and customer service Jason Friedman testified that the team had two sets of books and the team sent one to the league that “underreported certain ticket revenue.”
The Commanders also retained around $5 million in security deposits from up to 2,000 customers since 2016, the committee report said. 
The investigation by the House Oversight Committee began last year with a look at over 650,000 emails under a separate probe into sexual harassment claims by former employees.
The Commanders “categorically denies any suggestion of financial impropriety of any kind at any time,” ..."

During that time, Benzinga sought to recognize the innovation in digital assets, broadly, and spoke with founders, investors and beyond.
The following is a conversation with Ray Youssef, the CEO and founder of Paxful, a global, peer-to-peer platform building a financial system for the 100%, one Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) at a time. Check it out!
Q: Hi Ray, nice to meet you. Care to start off with an introduction?
Ray Youssef: I’m a startup and tech guy. I’ve had many startups – in the double-digits – and here I am in bitcoin.
I was born in Egypt and grew up in New York. I like building products for human beings and, actually, helping people. I have a crazy dream that everyone can be rich.
People don’t have to be poor for others to be wealthy; we can all have plenty.
I’m building a machine, a tool that humans can use to free themselves from economic apartheid and that is all built on bitcoin because I view bitcoin as the only honest money we really have.
Honest money will lead to peace.
How did you find bitcoin?
The first time I heard about it – 2011 – I dismissed it as nerd money. However, in 2013, I started to dig in and read the white paper.
I learned bitcoin could sustain itself and the incentivization model for miners impressed me.
This was a programmer and he designed a beautiful system, which is Layer Zero.
What humanity really needs is a civilization kit. You need to be able to take open-source code, fork it, and run your whole country. Most of the governance is about money.

During that time, the company checked out digital assets innovation and spoke with founders, investors and entrepreneurs.
The following is a conversation with Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur Jordan Edelson, the CEO and founder of TradeZing, a live-streaming social engagement Web3 platform designed for millennial and Generation Z traders. Check it out!
Benzinga: Care to start off with an introduction?
Jordan Edelson: I’m an entrepreneur and started my first business when I was 14 years old.
I’m a self-taught programmer that created mods in video games and worked with teams remotely. That gave me a very early view of management and team building.
Then, I moved on and created pretty much what Twitch TV is today, about 20 years ago. It was the ability to stream video games to the web. I pioneered the technology and it was under a company — Esports TV and Game Broadcasting Live — that I owned.
I didn’t get a $980 million exit to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) but I did well with the property. I ran it for about eight years and we were streaming esports video games with Samsung as a partner and all over the world.
Then, I was CTO of the first publicly traded hip hop company, H3 Enterprises.
I worked with Russell Simmons and Dr. Benjamin Franklin Chavis Jr. on hip-hop-themed restaurants. My connection to that was through a deal I formed between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Paramount Global’s (NASDAQ: PARA)(NASDAQ: PARAA) Viacom.
We built these centers at which you could play video games on the tabletops.
Later, I started a digital agency right at the onset of the Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. That skyrocketed my career in the mobile app development space and I still own an agency, probably the largest for mobile app development in ..."

2022-04-21T13:53:45Z,Analysis: How Can Netflix Get Its Mojo Back?,"In the parlance of old-time show business, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) laid an egg this week. The streaming service’s first-quarter earnings report, with its ill news of a 200,000 drop in subscribers — the first decline since 2011 — was greeted with a wave of negativity not seen since the critics’ screening for “Heaven’s Gate.” Even worse, the company’s profitable revenue stream was denigrated for not meeting the consensus’ expectations.
Sadly, the company went into panic mode and hastily began slapping ill-fitting Band-Aids on the scars that its critics carved into its flesh — promises of cracking down on password sharing and hints at adding advertising to its presentations were thrown about like New Year’s confetti. Shareholders were mostly unimpressed and the stock tanked, while the financial news media had a field day with the company’s perceived wreckage.
But in the calmness of retrospective analysis, Netflix’s situation could have been much, much worse. For Netflix to go forward, it needs a game plan that will acknowledge difficulties without being held hostage to them while building up its existing muscle. There are four key steps that Netflix should take in looking ahead into the near-future.

1. It’s A Different World Today: Quite frankly, Netflix in early 2022 was in the wrong place at the wrong time — a streaming service in mostly oversaturated markets that were being pockmarked by abnormal inflationary pressures. Translated: the target consumer for these services is probably already a subscriber, but ongoing economic challenges are forcing people to sacrifice streaming subscriptions as part of a cost-cutting regimen.
The good news is that Netflix is still the world’s leading streaming service with 221.64 million subscribers and a first-quarter profit of $1.6 billion in profit on $7.8 billion in quarterly sales, a 10% year-over-year revenue spike. If that’s your definition of a failing company, maybe you need a new dictionary.
The bad news is that Netflix is forecasting it will lose 2 million subscribers in the second quarter. But there is good news in that dismal forecast — rival streamers such as Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS), Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ: CMCSA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are in the same boat and could see even greater losses. Indeed, a recent Deloitte survey determined U.S. streaming subscriber churn is 38%, with the main reason for cancellations stemming from rising subscription costs. (However, Deloitte also found 25% of customers who canceled a streaming service resubscribed to it within a year — go figure!)
And there is more good news for Netflix — the research company Antenna identified Apple TV+ as having the highest ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

Australia Inflation Rate YoY Q1
Australia's quarterly inflation report is due this coming Wednesday. The country has been curiously immune to the worst inflationary pressure seen elsewhere, like the US (8.5%), the UK (7%), and across the ditch in New Zealand (6.9%).
As recorded in the previous quarter, Australia's inflation rate stands at 3.5%. However, it is not expected to remain so low in the next reading. It is likely to be the last inflationary figure before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) moves to increase its interest rate. When the RBA does make this move, it will be the first of its kind in more than a decade.
Expectations are for a 50 basis point hike by the RBA ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

One streaming company reported a strong gain in the same quarter and could be taking market share from Netflix.
What Happened: HBO Max and HBO, which are now part of the spun-off Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), reported growth in the first quarter of 2022, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The two units ended the quarter with 76.8 million global subscribers, including 46.8 million in U.S. global subscribers, which were up by three million in the quarter and incorporated a gain of 1.8 million in the U.S. Over the past 12 months, HBO and HBO Max have added 12.8 million subscribers.
The first quarter for HBO and HBO Max came in stark contrast to Netflix, which reported its subscriber count was down 200,000 in the quarter. Netflix also guided to lose two million subscribers in the second quarter.
The average revenue per user for HBO/HBO Max rose slightly from $11.15 to $11.24 for domestic subscribers and hit $11.72 for global subscribers in the first quarter.
The first quarter follows a fourth quarter that saw strong growth and included the release of “Dune” and “The Matrix Resurrections” on HBO Max.

(Friday Market Open) Another day, another round of earnings reports. However, the dark cloud of rising interest rates appears to be hanging over investors as equity index futures point to a lower open. Even the “happiest place on earth” is facing another storm.
Potential Market Movers
Disney (DIS) has lost ground after revelations from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) that its streaming service had lost subscribers and expects to lose many more. Now, the Florida legislature has voted to end Disney’s 50-year-old special self-governing district by June 1, 2023. The self-governing district allowed Disney to collect taxes, provide emergency services, and build new structures without local government approval. However, according to CNBC, the move may result in Florida taxpayers absorbing a $1 billion bond debt. There’s also the question of whether Florida will now be entitled to the additional tax revenue that the special Disney district was collecting as well as building and permit fees. Obviously, there’s a lot more to come on this story and how it will  affect Disney going forward.
While Disney is dealing with its own issues, the rest of the market will likely be undergoing another revaluation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s more hawkish tone on Thursday caused stocks to fall and yields to rise. On the bright side, the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) was down about 16 basis points in premarket trading which may take some of the sting out of valuation calculations.
The dreary outlook is even affecting companies with otherwise positive earnings reports. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reported that it hit analysts’ earnings estimates on the nose and saw better-than-expected revenues, but still fell 1.6% in pre-market trading. VZ issued forward guidance at the lower end of its fiscal 2022 range. The lower guidance came as VZ cut its sales forecast and reported struggles with inflation. One problem Verizon is likely expecting is that budget-conscious consumers will likely be looking for cheaper carrier plans as inflation pushes tighter household purse strings.
American Express (NYSE: AXP) was also trading lower despite beating on top and bottom-line numbers. AXP was down about 1% before the market open when the company failed to raise its earnings outlook and only reaffirmed previous guidance.  
Despite higher gold prices, Newmont (NYSE: NEM) missed on earnings and revenue estimates due to higher extraction and production costs. The company added an additional 5% for costs in its 2022 outlook. Management effectiveness is key in a time of rising input costs, which means NEM managers need to find a way to cut costs elsewhere if possible. Newmont was down 4.1% in premarket trading, adding to its Thursday loss of 6.7%.
One company that appears to be managing costs while benefiting from higher commodity prices is Schlumberger (NYSE: SL). Not only did the company beat ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"

Twice As Many Minutes Were Watched For 'Bridgerton' Than Any Other Streaming Programs,"Dearest readers should know that a hit show on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) is absolutely dominating the streaming charts. Here are the latest rankings.
What Happened: The beloved streaming original “Bridgerton” premiered a second season on Netflix on March 25. The show broke records in its first weekend, which means it should come as no surprise that it topped the streaming charts from Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE: NLSN), as reported by Variety.
Nielsen groups show as one, meaning it counts episodes from all seasons. For the week of March 21 through March 27, “Bridgerton” topped the list with 2.55 billion minutes watched. The total was more than twice the second-place finisher.
Nielsen’s ranking covers TV sets only, not including computers or mobile devices. The ratings also only cover U.S. audiences.
Here’s the list of overall top streaming programs (original, acquired and movies) for the week of March 21 through March 27.

1. Bridgerton (Netflix): 2.55 billion minutes
2. The Adam Project (Netflix): 1.19 billion minutes
3. Is It Cake? (Netflix): 1.18 billion minutes

(NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk finally wrapped up the Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) deal on Monday. Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is raising concerns about Tesla's reliance on China as a market and its implication for Twitter with the new owner.
What Happened:  Bezos questioned whether the Chinese government has gained a bit of leverage over Twitter following its deal to be acquired by Musk.
His query came while quote-tweeting New York Times reporter Mike Forsythe's observation on Musk's business links with China and Twitter's ban in China — which has been in place since 2009. 
Bezos also answered himself by stating that the deal would mean more complexity for Tesla in China rather than the implication it has for Twitter's censorship. The billionaire also suggested that it ..."

2022-04-26T14:56:30Z,Analysis: Will Elon Musk's Twitter Kowtow To Chinese Communist Party Influence?,"When Elon Musk first notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about his desire to take over Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and turn it into a privately-held company, he stated, “I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”
Musk did not give details on how he would “unlock” the “extraordinary potential” at Twitter, which was founded in 2006, nor did he offer a hint of his concept of “free speech” — contrary to popular opinion, the First Amendment doesn’t apply to messaging on private sector platforms. Many people assumed Musk would be returning many Twitter-banned individuals and entities to the platform, including former President Donald Trump and The Babylon Bee news satire site, but Musk never said that was his goal.
Indeed, no one knows how Musk plans to run Twitter now that he has acquired the company. One of Musk’s most prominent critics, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, opined: “Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?”
Maybe Bezos is the wrong messenger in this particular case, considering his business ties to China and his rivalry with Musk, but the message deserves attention. China’s government and several Chinese corporations working with the government’s blessings have provided the cash to support Musk’s corporate success, and he has responded with near-slavish devotion to his Beijing benefactors.
Quite frankly, what role, if any, will China’s government play in a Musk-run Twitter?
A Reason For Concern? Musk wasn’t always the world’s richest man, and on multiple occasions he received Chinese financial assistance. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis, this included loans that Musk received from Chinese banks in 2019 and 2020 plus a $1.4 billion facility to help with the construction of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) factory in Shanghai.
In 2017, the Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd. (OTC: TCHEY) acquired a 5% stake in Tesla, which Musk welcomed by tweeting about how he was “glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla.” Tencent operates the WeChat social media app banned under the Trump administration over data privacy issues; President Joe Biden lifted that ban last June.
Last November, the Shanghai-based Leo Group attempted to make a $50 million investment in Musk’s privately held SpaceX through a partnership deal, but that fell through when the partnership was abruptly terminated after Leo Group’s input.
The extent of Chinese investment in SpaceX is not clear, and U.S. Rep Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, has been seeking confidential briefings with federal agencies to ascertain the links between SpaceX and China’s government.
“I am a fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX, but anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China,” said Stewart. “Congress doesn’t have good eyes on this.”
There is also the question of how Musk is paying for this acquisition. Washington Post columnist Maureen McArdle acknowledged the news of Musk’s transaction by tweeting, “The carrying costs ..."

2022-04-29T12:39:30Z,Could Elon Musk Really Be 'The Simpsons' Villain Hank Scorpio?,"By Hernán Panessi via El Planteo. 
He's happy, he looks like he got it.
Homer Simpson receives a basket of food and, also, a nice welcome. After years of grumbling with Mr. Burns, Homer has changed jobs. His boss is the very nice Hank Scorpio (""The Simpsons,"" Season 8, Episode 2, 1996).
""I've never liked to see myself on top of other people. I'm just like you. Sure, I have better hours, I earn a lot more, I get more vacation time, but I'm not more than you,"" Scorpio tells Homer.
However, minutes later, Hank reveals himself as a psychopath who threatens the United Nations with a nuclear device, is determined to kill Mr. Bont - a hero who parodies James Bond, and faces an army carrying a flamethrower because of a ""little problem with the government.""
Oddly enough, Hank never stopped being nice to Homer. Thus, the question arises: Can people be relatable and, at the same time, a supervillain?
In the edges of the Internet, a conspiracy theory was soon woven: What if, in reality, Hank Scorpio is inspired by a real-life character?
The Simpsons Know The Truth
The predictive ability of Matt Groening's animated series is well known: from Donald Trump’s presidency, through the attack on the Twin Towers, the 2016 Rolling Stones tour and so many more events.

2022-05-02T13:47:21Z,A Chat With Rep. Nancy Mace: The South Carolina Republican Behind The Largest Ever Cannabis Legalization Bill In The US,"“Did you have time to shower?” asks Nancy Mace, the conservative, military school-educated, Republican House Representative for South Carolina, who is behind the most comprehensive cannabis legalization in bill the U.S. - the States Reform Act. Mace’s bill has supporters that run the gamut from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity and a whole lot in between.
She knows I rushed to meet her after a sleepless 18-hour flight from Argentina to Austin and had barely 30 minutes to swing by my hotel, take a quick shower and throw on a button-up shirt.
After my affirmative response regarding the shower, she jokes: “You can sit next to me then.”
""Cannabis Got Me Through Tough Times""
Wasting no time, Mace, who is surprisingly cool and relaxed, jumps right into the topic at hand, beginning with her personal story. Warning: it’s pretty tough.
“I dropped out of school right at my 17th birthday. I had been raped by a classmate of mine,” she discloses but does not miss a beat.
“When I went through this experience, one of the toughest things I’ve ever been through in my life, my doctor prescribed me antidepressants because it was a traumatic event – physically, emotionally, mentally, a horrific event in my life.”
Mace recalls that the prescription medications exacerbated her depression. “I had to get off of them or I was going to kill myself.”
This is when she started experimenting with cannabis. For a short period of time, she found solace in the plant; it helped her keep her anxiety at bay and sleep better at night. “It really got me through some tough times.”
Your Experiences Mold Your Views
Nearly three decades have passed since that life-changing experience. Now that she’s had time to process it and build on it, Mace recognizes the impact the episode has had on her viewpoints and opinions.
“Without that experience, I wouldn't be here today,” she says, reminiscing about her days as a waitress at the Waffle House after dropping out of high school, her return to school and her experience of becoming the first woman to graduate from The Citadel in 1999.
“Cannabis was what helped get me through these tough experiences,” she continues. ""And so, when I talk to veterans, I talk to people that have PTSD or other health issues, I understand it because I've experienced it myself, personally. I get it and I can connect with the people that are struggling, and understand why there’s such strong support for cannabis reform in the United States.”
Across Party Lines
It’s amazing to ponder that Mace, a South Carolina Republican with military affiliations, is the woman behind such an important cannabis legalization bill. Still lingering in the shared US consciousness, weed is a thing for hippies and left-wing liberals, certainly not celebrated, or even tolerated, within traditional Armed Forces circles. Yet, Mace defies these notions. 
“When you talk to our soldiers who come home from war, you see the rate of suicide in our country [is out of control], the rate of addiction to hardcore drugs like opioids… Those have had a tremendously detrimental effect on our military, our soldiers and our veterans,” the Representative stresses.
So, in crafting the States Reform Act, Mace added protection clauses for veterans as well as doctors working in Veterans Affairs (VA) who wish to use or prescribe cannabis as a medication. This means these people would no longer face the risk of being discriminated by their health choices.
“Veterans’ issues are really near and dear to my heart, so I wanted to make sure that, when I was crafting this bill, I included those protections… When they come home ..."

Musk announced he was acquiring the social media platform for $54.20 per share. Since then, Twitter shares have traded lower over concerns that the deal will be approved. Twitter will likely be a top-searched ticker during the acquisition approval process.

Wade Leak Draws Reactions: Elizabeth Warren Says 'Not Going Back,' Bernie Sanders Wants Codification, And More","A leaked draft opinion authored by a U.S. Supreme Court Justice suggesting the highest court of the United States will overturn Roe V. Wade has led to a barrage of criticism on social media, particularly from left-leaning politicians.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted that Congress “must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW.”
“If there aren’t 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes,” he said.

Earlier in March, a Senate filibuster prevented a bill to codify Roe V. Wade, according to a report from MSNBC.

This ruling could put the banning or keeping abortions legal in the hands of states. A ban on abortions by states could have an impact on filming locations, sporting events and company headquarters.
What Happened: Among the industries reacting to a potential overturning of Roe v. Wade are movie and television studios. WGA West (Writers Guild of America West) is pushing for Hollywood studios to stop filming movies and television shows in states that ban abortions.
“In light of the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on abortion rights, we want to reaffirm our Guild’s commitment to fighting on our members’ behalf against inequality and discrimination,” the Guild’s Board of Directors said. “Women’s rights are human rights, and any laws that ban or limit a woman’s right to choose are dangerous and set a precedent for further erosion of our collective civil rights.”
The Actors’ Equity Association, which represents more than 51,000 actors and live theater stage managers, also spoke out about the potential ruling.
“We support bodily autonomy for all. We stand opposed to any efforts by the Supreme Court, or any other body, to roll back human rights. We stand opposed to oppression. We stand in solidarity,” the organization said.
The Actors’ Equity Association did not say they would push for a ban against states that make abortion illegal, instead choosing to show solidarity at this point ahead of a potential ruling.

The report says lobbying in U.S. politics topped $2 billion in 2021. The report also showed that lobbying companies were more likely to be invested in by members of Congress than nonlobbying companies.

Internet firms like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) were among those to reap substantial gains from the tech boom during the pandemic. Zoom’s stock surged to a record $559 in October 2020 around the time that its platform’s usage became ubiquitous for people working at home and regular users that wanted to connect with friends and families.
The confidence in Zoom and other internet stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) fueled a herd mentality that propelled the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to an all-time high in November 2020.
But with concerns about high valuations and interest rate hikes that could lower companies’ future earnings, the Nasdaq has been on a freefall for about half a year now, retreating from its November peak of over 16,000 points to an over 18-month low of just under 12,000 points on Wednesday.

Those losses are accompanied by two earnings reports from consumer behemoths, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which showed higher fuel costs, higher wages and supply chain constraints denting profits amid the highest inflation in the last four decades.
Despite consumer demand being high and companies getting away with passing off higher production costs via higher prices, the S&P 500 is sliding into bear market territory amid fears the Fed will hike interest rates at a rate that will send the U.S. into a recession.
The most recent fall Thursday in the S&P 500 puts the index on the edge of an official bear market, tumbling 18.7% from its Jan. 3 highs of 4,796. If it falls an additional 1.3% showing a 20% fall from the highs, it enters an official bear market.
